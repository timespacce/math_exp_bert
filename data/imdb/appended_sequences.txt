[CLS] i have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about - this was a wonderful movie , and created a sense of the era that feels like time travel . [SEP] we came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie . [SEP]
[CLS] the characters are truly young , mary is a strong match for byron , claire is juvenile and a tad annoying , pol ##ido ##ri is a convincing beaten - down sy ##co ##pha ##nt . [SEP] honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck . [SEP]
[CLS] all are beautiful , curious , and decade ##nt . [SEP] this one acts as a satire during the women ##s rights movement era . [SEP]
[CLS] not the frightening wreck ##s they are in gothic . [SEP] gothic works as an independent piece of shock film , and i loved it for different reasons , but this works like a merchant and ivory film , and was from my readings the best capture of what the summer must have felt like . [SEP]

[CLS] you see that today , or even in 1925 , on one side of the world a lady or a baby could have everything served for him or her clean and on - demand , but here 80 years ago , people ventured their life to go to somewhere with more grass .

[CLS] as for the first . [SEP] this movie is one of the most fun movies ever made . [SEP]
[CLS] as i said , it had much more potential . [SEP] it reflects the surreal ##ity of the situation they ##re in , that he ##s sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby . [SEP]
[CLS] i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension . [SEP] it felt like a slight acid trip . [SEP]
[CLS] much more tension . [SEP] brian de palma ##s und ##enia ##ble vi ##rt ##uo ##sity can ##t really camouflage the fact that his plot here is a thin ##ly disguised " psycho " carbon copy , but he does provide a genuinely terrifying climax . [SEP]
[CLS] and the potential tension didn ##t get through . [SEP] yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] yeah . [SEP] this movie rocks . [SEP]
[CLS] i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack . [SEP] gothic works as an independent piece of shock film , and i loved it for different reasons , but this works like a merchant and ivory film , and was from my readings the best capture of what the summer must have felt like . [SEP]
[CLS] the actors . [SEP] not enough sensual ##ity in the key moments . [SEP]

[CLS] when they ##re caught , they ##re penned in an area where the match remains within ears ##hot , but out of sight .

[CLS] given the pe ##di ##gree of its director , ja ##far pan ##ah ##i , it was di ##sar ##ming to discover that offs ##ide is a comedy , and a frequently hilarious one .

[CLS] however , thinking now about offs ##ide , its hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy , because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous . [SEP] as the women demand to know why they can ##t watch the soccer match and their capt ##ors struggle to answer , the only possible outcome is comedy . [SEP]
[CLS] as the women demand to know why they can ##t watch the soccer match and their capt ##ors struggle to answer , the only possible outcome is comedy . [SEP] do we need to be reminded of that ? [SEP]
[CLS] what makes offs ##ide most affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system . [SEP] here she has a chance to be charming without the dark side of her pa ##bs ##t collaboration . [SEP]
[CLS] they are simply soccer fans and patriots , and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfair ##ly , they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nations grasp . [SEP] sound anything like brave ##heart ? [SEP]
[CLS] you know , i went to see " the hills have eyes 2 " wanting to like it . [SEP] is a wonderful experience to behold . [SEP]
[CLS] i really enjoyed the original , and the remake was fairly entertaining . [SEP] they obviously had more money to throw around than wes craven did on special effects the second time around . [SEP]
[CLS] they obviously had more money to throw around than wes craven did on special effects the second time around . [SEP] particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition . [SEP]
[CLS] even though i still prefer the original film , the remake was done well , and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me . [SEP] bloody , intense , and great special effects . [SEP]
[CLS] bloody , intense , and great special effects . [SEP] i mean , they are chasing a car through the mountains , a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour , yet they can ##t catch up to it ? [SEP]
[CLS] in short , a great popcorn movie for any horror fan . [SEP] the two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse . [SEP]
[CLS] which brings us to " the hills have eyes 2 " . [SEP] the other problem with two harbor ##s is the acting . [SEP]

[CLS] once again the special effects by nico ##ter ##o are great , but the kills no matter how graphic become boring , and predictable . [SEP] i am surprised this didn ##t make it into general release . [SEP]

[CLS] pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the side . [SEP] i think the worst thing was the underwater scenes held off of the dock . [SEP]
[CLS] another problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many of the girls bound themselves to jake . [SEP] the actors . [SEP]
[CLS] a few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached . [SEP] one girl said " if i don ##t get that first impression rose it will kill me ! [SEP]

[CLS] and in my opinion , one of the best movies ever made . [SEP] it could have been a decent movie , but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] this movie has some things that are pretty amazing . [SEP] not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and im ##o fresh visual style . [SEP]
[CLS] first , it is supposed to be based on a true story . [SEP] ok ? [SEP]
[CLS] that , in itself , is amazing that multiple tornadoes would hit the same town at night in the fall - in nebraska . [SEP] there is an ain ##sworth , nebraska , but there is also a town that starts with b ##lain ##s - something . [SEP]

[CLS] on the other hand , the scene where the tv goes fuzzy is based in fact . [SEP] and tuned the brightness just right , you could tell if there was a tornado coming . [SEP]
[CLS] and tuned the brightness just right , you could tell if there was a tornado coming . [SEP] the tango also plays a plot point in " prix , " being the music she danced with on her short rise to star ##dom after becoming miss europe . [SEP]
[CLS] the problem was that by then you would be able to hear it . [SEP] actors , and its not an everyday occurrence that actors can play out such a role and have it be somewhat bel ##ie ##vable . [SEP]
[CLS] since i know something about midwest tornadoes , it made this movie fun for me . [SEP] i enjoy it more than twist ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] i enjoy it more than twist ##er . [SEP] theirs is the more scandal ##ous story , perhaps even more interesting in a de ##pr ##ave ##d way , but denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and un ##res ##olved relationships . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , give me a break - there is no way you could make it through and f ##5 by chain ##ing yourself to a pipe in a well house .

[CLS] f ##yi im in my late 20s ##1 ##st of all i have to admit i really like animated movies , because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one .

[CLS] the premise was not un ##int ##eres ##ting , but the movie starts and ends there . [SEP] and was extremely emotional about it . [SEP]
[CLS] the acting was ok , though the characters were utterly boring . [SEP] theirs is the more scandal ##ous story , perhaps even more interesting in a de ##pr ##ave ##d way , but denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and un ##res ##olved relationships . [SEP]
[CLS] for the protagonist to aim at such an au ##da ##cious goal , she is might ##ily empty . [SEP] the closest they come to an actual confrontation is when they get into a sc ##uf ##fle with some not so palestinian - friendly locals who try to prevent them from handing out the leaflets . [SEP]

[CLS] i cannot say anything more about exactly why without partially spoil ##ing it , and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that . [SEP] they ##re blunt , awkward and annoying ##ly confused about everything . [SEP]
