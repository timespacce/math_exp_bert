i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid . i cried every time i watched it . it wasn ##t weird to me . i totally identified with the characters . i would love to see it again ( and hope i won ##t be disappointed ! ) . pu ##f ##nst ##uf rocks ! i was really drawn in to the fantasy world . and to me the movie was lo ##oo ##ong . i wonder if i ever saw the series and have confused them ? the acting i thought was strong . i loved jack wilde . he was so dream ##y to an 10 year old ( when i first saw the movie , not in 1970 . i can still remember the characters vivid ##ly . the flute was totally bel ##ie ##vable and i can still feel the evil woods . witch ##y po ##o was scary - i wouldn ##t want to cross her path .
i have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about - this was a wonderful movie , and created a sense of the era that feels like time travel . the characters are truly young , mary is a strong match for byron , claire is juvenile and a tad annoying , pol ##ido ##ri is a convincing beaten - down sy ##co ##pha ##nt . all are beautiful , curious , and decade ##nt . not the frightening wreck ##s they are in gothic . gothic works as an independent piece of shock film , and i loved it for different reasons , but this works like a merchant and ivory film , and was from my readings the best capture of what the summer must have felt like . romantic , yes , but completely re ##kind ##les my interest in the lives of shelley and byron every time i think about the film . one of my all - time favorites .
this was soul - pro ##voking ! i am an iranian , and living in th 21st century , i didn ##t know that such big tribes have been living in such conditions at the time of my grandfather ! you see that today , or even in 1925 , on one side of the world a lady or a baby could have everything served for him or her clean and on - demand , but here 80 years ago , people ventured their life to go to somewhere with more grass . its really interesting that these persians bear those difficulties to find pasture for their sheep , but they lose many the sheep on their way . i praise the americans who accompanied this tribe , they were as tough as ba ##kh ##tia ##ri people .
this was a wonderful ##ly clever and entertaining movie that i shall never tire of watching many , many times . the casting was magnificent in matching up the young with the older characters . there are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format . as for ju ##di den ##ch , she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which she stars . i always make a point to see ju ##di den ##ch in all her performances . she is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life . i can only be grateful when i see such an outstanding picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters , good scripts and good acting . the movie public needs heroes , not devi ##ant mani ##kins , who lack ing ##en ##uity and talent . how wonderful to see old favorites like leslie car ##on , olympia du ##ka ##kis and cl ##eo lai ##ne . i would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves . thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment . i cong ##rat ##ulate the writer , director , producer , and all those who did such a fine job .
a very close and sharp disc ##rip ##tion of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of special ##y one 18 ##year old guy , that makes his first experiences in his gay love to an other boy , during an vacation with a part of his family . i liked this film because of his ex ##tre ##ml ##y clear and sur ##rogated storytelling , with all this " sound - close - ups " and quiet moments wi ##ch had been full of intensive moods .
i saw this film on true movies ( which automatically made me sc ##ept ##ical ) but actually - it was good . why ? not because of the amazing plot twists or breath ##taking dialogue ( of which there is little ) but because actually , despite what people say i thought the film was accurate in its depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy . its not dawson ##s creek , they ##re not graceful , cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effort ##less knowledge . they ##re kids and they act like kids would . they ##re blunt , awkward and annoying ##ly confused about everything . yes , this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but i don ##t think so . der ##mot mu ##lr ##oney gives ( when not trying to be cool ) a very bel ##ie ##vable performance and i loved him for it . patricia ar ##quette is w ##hin ##y and annoying , but she was pregnant and a teenagers ? the combination of the two isn ##t exactly lavender on your pillow . the plot was very predictable and but so what ? i believed them , his stress and inability to cope - her brave , yet slightly mis ##guide ##d attempts to bring them closer together . i think the characters , acted by anyone else , would indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren ##t . it reflects the surreal ##ity of the situation they ##re in , that he ##s sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby . i felt angry at her for that , i felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her . i felt it all . in the end , i loved it and would recommend it . watch out for the scene where der ##mot mu ##lr ##oney runs from the disastrous counsel ##ling session - career performance .
i think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second , as someone else wrote in a comment , the implications of this kind of relationships ( inc ##est and lesbian ##ism ) in the romanian society . so . to begin with the second aspect . to make it short , it wasn ##t visible at all . as for the first . as i said , it had much more potential . i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension . much more tension . and the potential tension didn ##t get through . i think the soundtrack could ##ve been more than those few songs on the background and the theme ( wi ##ch was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments ) . yeah . i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack . the actors . i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 8 / 10 . not enough sensual ##ity in the key moments . a total of 7 / 10 . mostly for the story
several young iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a world cup qualifying match between iran and bahrain . when they ##re caught , they ##re penned in an area where the match remains within ears ##hot , but out of sight . the prisoners plead to be let go , but rules are rules . given the pe ##di ##gree of its director , ja ##far pan ##ah ##i , it was di ##sar ##ming to discover that offs ##ide is a comedy , and a frequently hilarious one . in 1997 ##s the mirror , pan ##ah ##i presents two versions of iranian girl ##hood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is " real " . in 2000s the circle , several iranian women step outside the system ##; their trans ##gre ##ssion ##s are different , but they all end up in the same tragic place . however , thinking now about offs ##ide , its hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy , because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous . as the women demand to know why they can ##t watch the soccer match and their capt ##ors struggle to answer , the only possible outcome is comedy . what makes offs ##ide most affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system . they are simply soccer fans and patriots , and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfair ##ly , they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nations grasp .
you know , i went to see " the hills have eyes 2 " wanting to like it . i really enjoyed the original , and the remake was fairly entertaining . they obviously had more money to throw around than wes craven did on special effects the second time around . even though i still prefer the original film , the remake was done well , and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me . bloody , intense , and great special effects . in short , a great popcorn movie for any horror fan . which brings us to " the hills have eyes 2 " . man , where do i start ? the plot , or lack of one , is paper thin . we are not exactly breaking new ground here . the military has decided to monitor the area , and all of these people turn up missing . so what do we do now ? lets send in the national guard to investigate . in true hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumb ##est , and worst soldiers ever seen . gee , iv ##e never seen that premise before . to make a long story short , you have the mutants killing off the mor ##on soldiers one at a time in graphic fashion . once again the special effects by nico ##ter ##o are great , but the kills no matter how graphic become boring , and predictable . honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck . it was bloody , and graphic , but i found it predictable , boring , and not scary at all . for me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thought . wes craven and his son shared the writing duties , and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror films , but sadly this isn ##t one of them .
i haven ##t seen this film in years so my knowledge is a little rusty . i do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of brave ##heart . it is simply more realistic and has more bel ##ie ##vable characters . rid ##b roy looks like one would imagine rob roy to look like , messy hair and beard with simple clothing . also the liam ness ##on has a celtic look about him , he looks like a sc ##ot and more importantly looks like rob roy . its a comparison which anger ##s some people but compare him to mel gibson as william wallace . gibson is supposedly playing a man who ##s legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while gibson is almost a foot shorter . the story contains a little romance , conspiracy and an under ##dog story . sound anything like brave ##heart ? but instead of a film that cries out " freedom " , liberty and nationalism we get a film which says honour , love and justice . this makes it a more interesting film . much like glad ##ia ##tor . the cast is fantastic and liam ness ##on is a very strong leader in this endeavour . the story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity . the scene where mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true scottish strength is followed by her washing the se ##men from her crotch in an extreme panic . this is something a heroine in brave ##heart would never do . overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch . go and see it !
sitting down to watch the 14th season of the bachelor ( " on the wings of love " ) , i knew i would be in for an " interesting " time . i had watched some of the previous seasons of the bachelor in passing ##; watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so . i find that the bachelor is often appealing and intriguing , though its quality and morality are often lacking . " on the wings of love " details the journey taken by jake , a 31 year old commercial pilot from dallas , texas , to find true love , as true a love as one can find in a season - long reality - drama dating show . jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country . he begins to get to know them a bit , but it is mostly superficial ##; how well can you get to know someone in a few 5 minute conversations ? jake tries to make his true intentions known from the very beginning , at least to the audience . he noted that he doesn ##t just want love or a good time , but he wants a fia ##nc [UNK] or wife . we can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition as well . if that is the case , it might explain , to a degree , some of the women ##s actions . the women are super competitive . while they don ##t even know jake at all yet , they are still in it to win it no matter what the cost . not only were the women competitive , but they were also confident and cat ##ty . threats , backs ##ta ##bbing , and warnings of " watch out ! " all show that these women weren ##t there for a good time either . jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal , but looking for " a connection . " however , the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress jake with said sex appeal . they arrived at the mansion in ski ##mp ##y dresses [UNK] either low - cut or short . while some girls seemed to maintain their sense of decor ##um , others missed that memo altogether . one girl , chan ##ny , noted that jake was a " good guy " to whom she could be a " naughty girl . " she went on to say that jake could land on her " runway anytime . " she got fl ##ack from the other girls for her provocative statement which showed their take on these situations . so , a reality dating show couldn ##t be that bad , could it ? besides the obvious issue of sex - driven attraction , there are other issues that mar this seemingly harmless show . is this the right way to find a future mate ##; v ##ying for someone ##s attention by fl ##au ##nting oneself to extreme proportions ? unfortunately , however , that is what america has reduced dating to these days : pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the side . another problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many of the girls bound themselves to jake . a few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached . one girl said " if i don ##t get that first impression rose it will kill me ! " as mentioned before , they don ##t even know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose , not just one of the 15 roses to keep from being eliminated . michelle , in particular , seemed to have some issues with attachment to jake . the other girls noticed it too . after one particular michelle outburst , vienna asserted that michelle had a " mental breakdown and we ##ve only been here an hour . " michelle got the last rose of the evening on the first show [UNK] narrowly missing elimination [UNK] and was extremely emotional about it . the other girls thought it was simply ridiculous . another girl also cried , but because she was eliminated . it began with survivor , and from there it just took off [UNK] reality tv . it shows our entertainment interests as a country ##; if we weren ##t watching the shows and giving them good ratings , the networks would not continue to run them . the only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of america is hooked . one thing is clear : america ( in general ) loves reality tv and its ensuing trapping ##s . this begs me to question : why is it that we even like reality tv ? what is it about it that draws us to it ? is it because we see the similarities to our own lives , or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others ? whatever it is that draws us to it , we should be careful of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds . im not saying that all reality tv shows are bad ##; however , i am saying that we need to evaluate each one . episodes used for critique : season premier and episode 2 .
brian de palma ##s und ##enia ##ble vi ##rt ##uo ##sity can ##t really camouflage the fact that his plot here is a thin ##ly disguised " psycho " carbon copy , but he does provide a genuinely terrifying climax . his " blow out " , made the next year , was an improvement .
being a fan of silent films , i looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time . i was pretty disappointed . as has been mentioned , the film seems to be one long , long , commercial for the maxwell automobile . perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length that it is , i may have enjoyed the film more . but it got old very fast . and while i recognize that reality is stretched many times in films , without less ##ening a viewers enjoyment , what was with the mexican bandits ? i mean , they are chasing a car through the mountains , a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour , yet they can ##t catch up to it ?
vanilla sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 movie ab ##re los o ##jos ( open your eyes ) . and in my opinion , a much more human and emotional version . tom cruise plays david aa ##mes , a selfish ego ##mania ##c who takes other peoples emotions for granted , and thinks only of himself . jason lee plays brian shelby , david ##s best , and in many ways , only friend . penelope cruz plays sofia serra ##no , brian ##s girlfriend whom acc ##omp ##anies him to david ##s birthday party . cameron diaz plays julie gia ##nni , david ##s occasional bed buddy . kurt russell plays dr . curtis mcc ##abe , a psychologist interviewing david . all of their interactions , and the consequences of them , make vanilla sky one of the most emotional , and complex thriller ##s ever made . i won ##t explain anymore of the plot , because its far more compelling , the less you know . ignore all people that call this film too confusing to follow . if you pay attention , you won ##t be confused . the film is very complex , but not confusing . and in my opinion , one of the best movies ever made .
this movie has some things that are pretty amazing . first , it is supposed to be based on a true story . that , in itself , is amazing that multiple tornadoes would hit the same town at night in the fall - in nebraska . i wonder if the real towns name was close to " b ##lain ##sworth " ( which is the towns name in the movie ) . there is an ain ##sworth , nebraska , but there is also a town that starts with b ##lain ##s - something . it does show the slow ##est moving tornadoes on record in the the seen where the boys are in the house . on the other hand , the scene where the tv goes fuzzy is based in fact . before do ##pp ##ler radar and weather radio , we were taught that if you turned your tv to a particular channel ( not on cable ) and tuned the brightness just right , you could tell if there was a tornado coming . the problem was that by then you would be able to hear it . since i know something about midwest tornadoes , it made this movie fun for me . i enjoy it more than twist ##er . i mean , give me a break - there is no way you could make it through and f ##5 by chain ##ing yourself to a pipe in a well house .
since my third or fourth viewing some time ago , iv ##e abs ##tained from la mama ##n et la put ##ain while i wait for the dvd . in the meantime , iv ##e read the french screenplay as well as alain philipp ##ons monograph on jean eu ##sta ##che . the latter ends with a frustrating film ##ography , eleven films , fiction , doc , and in - between , impossible to see or , in the cases of me ##s petite ##s amour ##eus ##es and le p [UNK] no [UNK] . , re - see . a few questions that hit me this moment : polish v [UNK] french is plenty col ##lo ##qui ##al ( un maximum d " un maximum d " ) . even so , does she have an accent ? i think i can tell she does . what does the absence of color add , especially at the single spot the fringe of the city is glimpse ##d ? how does this fringe differ from the sleep and journey that separates worlds of the tempest and the winters tale ? di ##tto alpha ##ville . we may imagine the el ##ap ##sed years since have done it , but does eu ##sta ##che deliberately ci ##rc ##ums ##cr ##ibe the films mil ##ieu ? is this an enchanted isle ? is alexandre ##s a fairy tale ? alexandre ##s always cho ##re ##og ##raph ##ing himself , worrying about how or where to stand or walk , what to say when , announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does . or is this his way of trying to cho ##re ##og ##raph others by doing it to himself ? how different is he from vertigo ##s scott ##ie ? ( i say , i think , very . ) what ##s the difference , and is there one , between eu ##sta ##ches l [UNK] , and tr ##uf ##fa ##uts , and god ##ards ? how different is the present l [UNK] ? isn ##t he still doing it , whatever it is , in recent roles , ir ##ma ve ##p , le porn ##og ##raph ##e , whatever , approaching old age ? once i arrived early for one in a series of mostly antoine doin ##el ( l [UNK] character ) tr ##uf ##fa ##ut films . for a long while , every three or five minutes , down the aisle would come a twenty - something male in scarf , tweed ##y coat , l [UNK] hair , with a direction - seeking nose . i have no idea whether this was conscious or unconscious mimic ##ry . i was that age , but have no idea what i myself looked like then . no scarf , at least . i do have a brother , though , who seems to have learned his carriage from br ##ess ##on .
last november , i had a chance to see this film at the reno film festival . i have to say that it was a lot of fun . a few tech errors aside , it was a great experience . i loved the writing and acting , especially from the guy that played the lead role . there is a lot of heart in this movie , a lot of wit to . i got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done , and they seemed real nice . all in all the whole movie was just a positive experience , and one id definitely recommend . the story was entertaining and cool , as a woman iv ##e been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy , and i could really understand his problems because of it . the movie does a great job of giving us people we can sy ##mp ##athi ##ze with . the friends in the movie are really well written to , they are realistic . i know people like these , i only wish im ##y friends and i could sound as cool as these people when we talk . the whole movie is just real cool , i wish there were more films out there like it . - jay ##den
this really was the worst movie i have ever seen . michael var ##tan is hot , but who is this woman ? and she looks absolutely awful through the whole movie , the hair is so bad ! they talk in like mono ##tone voices and there is no ##oo chemistry . the cover of the dvd does not even remotely come close to what the movie actually is . really , really boring . i had to fast forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch . i really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good ? h ##ha ##ha they literally just like talk and say " yeah " and there is no passion whatsoever . i could not tell at all that they were in love . im sorry but this was the sad ##des ##t excuse for a movie i think i have ever seen .
before i explain the " alias " comment let me say that " the desert trail " is bad even by the standards of western ##s staring the three st ##oo ##ges . in fact it features carmen la ##rou ##x as semi - bad girl juan ##ita , when you hear her mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as sen ##ori ##ta rita from the classic st ##oo ##ge short " saved by the belle " . in " the desert trail " john wayne gets to play the moe howard character and eddy chandler gets to play curly howard . like their st ##oo ##ge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53 - minute movie is moe hitting curly . wayne ##s character , a skirt chasing bully , is not very end ##earing , but is supposed to be the good guy . playing a traveling rodeo cowboy wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gun ##point and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been good - the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar ( actually even less after wayne rob ##s the box office ) . no explanation is given for wayne ##s ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl . things get complicated at this point because the villain ( al ferguson ) and his sidekick larry fine ( played by paul fix - who would go on to play sheriff micah on television ##s " the rifle ##man " ) see wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager . moe and curly get blamed . so moe and curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to smith and jones . who do they meet first but their old friend larry , whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest ( sen ##ori ##ta rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie ) . larry ##s sister is nicely played by a radiant ##ly beautiful mary ko ##rn ##man ( now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of hal roach ##s " our gang " shorts ) . ko ##rn ##man is the main reason to watch the mega - lame western and her scenes with moe and curly are much better than any others in the production , as if they used an entirely different crew to film them . even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film - making is staggering ##ly bad . the two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse . both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground , but there is no horse in the frame , the film stock is completely different , and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider . there is liberal use of stock footage in other places , none of it even remotely convincing . one thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where moe and curly get on their horses and ride away ( to screen right ) from a cabin as the posse is gallo ##ping toward the cabin from the left . the camera ##man follows the two st ##oo ##ges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse . outside of home movies i have never seen anything like this , not because it is looks stupid ( which it does ) but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner . they would film the two riders leaving and then rep ##osition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action . or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the fore ##ground and the posse approaching in the background . then again , what do i know ? im only a child .
i am a huge woody allen fan and so when i saw that this was playing at the cinema i couldn ##t help myself . i wanted to see how allen would follow up his magnificent film match point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in g . b . ( which is unique among allen ##s work ) along with what seems to be his new muse scarlett johan ##son . scoop is much lighter than mp and the humor is scoop ##s most enjoyable aspect . the plot revolves around johan ##sons character ( a journalism student ) who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave . she falls in love with a suspected serial killer ( jack ##man ) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding . oh and all of this is done with the help of a bum ##bling magician turned detective played by allen . i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed johan ##sons performance but i am a bit bias , i could watch a three hour film with johan ##son in ever frame and remain enchanted . she plays a di ##ts ##y , ya ##ppy , bum ##bling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of allen ##s stereo ##typical ne ##uro ##sis stricken character . she adds appropriate body language for comic effect . needles ##s to say almost anyone who sees this will find johan ##sons character sick ##ening ##ly cute and that is a plus . allen is allen . he is still playing the same character much like chaplin and his little tram ##p character . something that occur in this film makes me wonder if i will see the ne ##uro ##tic little h ##yp ##och ##ond ##ria ##c again however . he is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late . jack ##man is also enjoyable as the su ##ave , millionaire murder suspect . i cannot say that jack ##man does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less . in terms of the plot i cannot help but feel that this is fresh . in fact it stink ##s of curse of the jade scorpion . johan ##son and allen are more detective - like than anything . however i must app ##lau ##d allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical uno ##uts ##tan ##ding hollywood version of this film . instead of everything being black and white , things are painted in shades of gray . being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does une ##qui ##vo ##cal guilt . though the plot seemed old woody still has a kn ##ack for one liner ##s . i did find his all ##usions to his last film interesting . come for the humor , laugh and be merry . needles ##s to say if you enjoy allen ##s work watch it . if not watch something else .
oh yeah ! jenna jameson did it again ! yeah baby ! this movie rocks . it was one of the 1st movies i saw of her . and i have to say i feel in love with her , she was great in this move . her performance was outstanding and what i liked the most was the scenery and the wardrobe it was amazing you can tell that they put a lot into the movie the girls cloth were amazing . i hope this comment helps and u can buy the movie , the storyline is awesome is very unique and im sure u are going to like it . jenna amazed us once more and no wonder the movie won so many awards . her make - up and wardrobe is very very sexy and the girls on girls scene is amazing . specially the one where she looks like an angel . its a must see and i hope u share my interests
since the advent of literature , people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love . even more fascinating have always been the tales of impossible love , love that cannot be . the israeli filmmaker e ##yt ##an fox latest film [UNK] bubble " is about that . and then it is also not . the title of the film refers to the [UNK] " that is tel - aviv set against the background of the political realities of israel . the country ##s cosmopolitan and unofficial capital city doesn ##t have much in common with na ##bl ##us , a city in the palestinian west bank which also features in the film . it doesn ##t have much in common with the tense and hate ##ful atmosphere at the palestinian checkpoint ##s . actually , it doesn ##t seem to have much in common with anything surrounding it . the [UNK] " of tel - aviv allows people to have a lifestyle which isn ##t much different from what you may expect in any western city . teenage girls looking for britney spears records , a lifestyle magazine editor looking for a sexy cover for his next issue , trend ##y people sitting in trend ##y cafes discussing trend ##y things over cups of cap ##pu ##cci ##no and other similarly trend ##y drinks , while those at home are watching the local edition of pop idol . it is this [UNK] " that also has the potential to lu ##ll ones mind into a false sense of reality . the film evolve ##s around the lives of three young israelis who share a flat and , for the most part , try to stay out of politics . yell ##i , the camp owner and manager of [UNK] & ella " , a hip cafe , rarely leaves the city and prefers not to think about the [UNK] that surrounds them " . no ##am , a soft and easy ##going employee of a slightly avant ##guard record store , seems to be equally unwilling to engage in long political discussions and con ##tem ##pl ##ations . lulu , the only female of the lot , is on the contrary linked to the israeli left , although her political activities seem to be confined to [UNK] against the occupation " . yell ##i and no ##am naturally don ##t object to participating in these . lulu and her political friends make t - shirts with the rave ##s logo , put up posters and hand out booklet ##s advertising it in the neighbourhood . their main concern seems to be that there are never any actual palestinians participating and that the police might come and spoil all the fun for them again . the closest they come to an actual confrontation is when they get into a sc ##uf ##fle with some not so palestinian - friendly locals who try to prevent them from handing out the leaflets . in other words , predictable products of the [UNK] " . the opening scenes of the film take us to a checkpoint on a road to na ##bl ##us where we also find no ##am doing his reserve duty . a group of palestinians is being thoroughly checked before entering israel , among them a pregnant woman who suddenly goes into labour and gives birth to a still ##born child despite the best efforts from no ##am and the doctor who eventually arrives in an ambulance . the woman is comfort ##ed by a young man who later turns up on no ##ams doorstep in tel - aviv with his id which the latter obviously dropped during the ordeal on the border . his name is ash ##raf , he ##s palestinian and he ##s gay . and he hasn ##t just come to hand back the id , he has come to see no ##am . without a permit to live in israel and despite the initial hesitation from no ##ams flat ##mates he stays . he soon gets a jewish name and a job at yell ##is cafe . having grown up in jerusalem with hebrew , he doesn ##t have an arabic accent which makes it possible for him and his newly found friends to conceal his identity . the sky is light blue and the air is sweet . but it cannot last . for he has become part of an equation which was never meant to be . at one point , no ##am and ash ##raf watch a play called bent about two prisoners in a nazi concentration camp who have a love relationship which can never become physical or visible to the surrounding guards . they find a way of being together on another level , a metaphysical one , a level where no one else has access . this is also where our couple arrives in the end . and it couldn ##t have been much different for them , not in today ##s israel . [UNK] bubble " is a political statement about the bubble that bursts when confronted with the political realities of today ##s israel set against the background of a beautiful and awkward love story involving an israeli and a palestinian , the impossible love story in a divided world where no such things as compromise or other colours than black and white exist . [UNK] bubble " is also a beautiful film about people , gay and straight , inhabit ##ing that strange city , tel - aviv , shown through the eyes of people who really care about them . the films premise may have its flaws and the fatal chain of events may seem somewhat con ##st ##rued , but its strong message and emotional impact will not leave you untouched .
take your basic frankenstein flick , in ##ject some re ##ani ##mat ##or ( but not the good parts ) , and you have doctor hack ##enstein . certainly , this was obviously inspired by aforementioned films but it never material ##izes as anything special on its own . a scientist accidentally kills his wife , so the whole movie takes place over the course of one night as he attempts to revive his wife . to revive his wife , he decides to chop off body parts from some women that have become stranded and , coincidentally , decide to stay the night at his place . i can ##t really say the acting is bad , nor is the directing . everything here is just way too standard . what little attempts there are at humor actually work ( check out the scene when hack ##enstein keeps hiding behind his deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly be very upset if she saw him clutching a woman and a needle ) , but that ##s hardly enough to recommend this film . the music is decent , what blood that ##s there is decent , and the cast looks quite good . and for half of the time , i was even entertained by this film . but i never felt like this was anything more than a time waste ##r . avoid ##able . try frank ##en ##ho ##oke ##r instead .
i began riding horses fairly recently , and , as anyone who has ever ridden should know , i fell in love with horses and their world . i rented spirit on a w ##him , just trying to pack my life full of as much horse related material as i could , and i was surprised by the results . what i expected was a feel - good disney ##es ##que movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes . what i got was an amazing film , filled with beautiful scenery and animation , and an amazing storyline that has the great potential to warm ones heart . spirit is a wild mustang in the old west , whose entire world is brought crumbling down around him when he discovers the humans slowly taking over his homeland . the story un ##fold ##s with a wide array of characters , some human , some animals , all are well written and most are pleasant to watch on screen . i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story , and who has an appreciation for history and animals . one thing i forgot to mention , but that i feel is important , is that the animals in this film do not talk . this was a really nice vacation from the lady and the tram ##p animated movies that everyone today is used to .
what the f * @ # was this i just watched ? steven stop ! please ! this movie is ins ##ati ##ably bad and silly . in a bizarre departure from action and adventure , mr . sea ##gal is now fighting ( obviously ) wish - they - were - vampire like creatures with super human strength . ? ok ? oh , and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way ? wow ! even still in this movie however , to que ##ll sea ##gal ##s have - to - have - the - last - punch - and - no - one - can - kick - my - a $ ego , he is somehow stronger than they are . however all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him . come on , i can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer , but these are super human strength people . oh and get this , sea ##gal goes through a brief sting of identity issues , because apparently he and his co ##hort ##s in the film think he is wolverine ! oh my go . and worst than all of that ! yes , there is a worse than that . he has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face . they obviously sound nothing like him and i believe it may be one of the other actors in the film . it was pure madness . although i wanted to turn it off i always watch a movie to he end . this is an all time low even for your direct to video movies steven . awful ! awful ! awful ! two thumbs down ! red ##eme ##ption qualities ? well i guess so , i will be fair in that aspect . at least some of the special effects were ok , and i like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses . the women all were quite attractive im ##o . still , and i said still , it does not make up for the b ##lat ##ant x - men , underworld , ( insert your favorite zombie , vampire movie here ) rip off ! the director , writer , producer , all should be ban ##si ##hed & exile from the movie business . i think i feel the way that most people feel about blood ray ##ne ( and just about all other u ##we bo ##ll pictures ) about this film . that ##s my whole $ 1 . 00 on this film . view if you dare .
ku ##re ##ish ##i hasn ##t exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing . recent adapted tr ##aves ##ty ##s like intimacy have ruined great writing . but the mother sur ##pass ##es all his previous incarnation ##s , ec ##lip ##sing even my beautiful lau ##nd ##ret ##te . a middle - aged woman overcome ##s widow - hood by having a very car ##nal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally - weak daughter . the fact that you believe all this is credit to the quality of the acting as it is to the finite gift of the writing . and in daniel craig we have a st ##rut ##ting , bra ##sh , gruff anti - hero who denies the audience to ever question why a young stud would con ##tem ##plate bed ##ding a sa ##gging grandmother . beautifully shot , the film fails only in the weak depiction of the peripheral characters , but as a study of inc ##on ##ce ##iva ##ble lust , its a winner .
while watching this movie i was frustrated and distracted and by the end , i wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5 . i thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on . even my a . d . d couldn ##t keep up . it felt like a slight acid trip . everything looked flat , there was no dimension to anything . there were so many shapes , lines and patterns . i really wanted to stop the movie mid - way and smash my burned copy of this movie . but after i finish watching it , i went online to read up on the movie and i should have done a little research into this movie before watching . the secret of ke ##lls is loosely based on the true story about the original book of ke ##lls . a small boy , brendan , is given the task of penn ##ing new pages in what is set to be the greatest book ever written . this book will contain information that will help " change darkness into light . " brendan lives in the village of ke ##lls behind huge stone walls . taking place in the 8th century , brendan ##s uncle , the abbot of ke ##lls , is trying to build the wall to keep the vikings out . brendan ##s uncle insist he help complete the wall , but a traveler and keeper of " the book " secretly trains brendan to hon ##e in on his illustration skills , and convinces him to complete " the book " and carry out its word . the entire time i watched the movie i thought i was missing something because i didn ##t really understand what was going on . i figured i was just missing a piece of irish history . a simple google search taught me all i needed to know about the original book of ke ##lls . after reading many articles , my opinion of the movie greatly changed . the book of ke ##lls is a copied version of the first few books of the new testament transcribed into latin by gaelic monks in ireland in the 8th century . along with its pale ##ographic and ins ##ular script , the book is also beautifully illustrated in ins ##ular art , a type of early art form know for its int ##rica ##cy , complexity , and miniature illustrations . much of the art in the book of ke ##lls is depicted as lots of art was at the time , flat and dimensional ##ity challenged with no perspective . but what makes the book of ke ##lls stand out from other early pieces of art is its use of many colors . the secret of ke ##lls is very colorful . i originally thought the animation was flat and boring . it reminded me a lot of the cartoon samurai jack which also had a flat and " amin ##e " look to it . once i learned about the art styles of the book of ke ##lls , its obvious that many of the styles from the book are mimic ##ked in the movie . there are lines and swirl ##s and various shapes that inhabit brendan ##s mind . whenever he goes into his imagination , circular shapes resembling the sun , co ##gs , clocks and wheels begin filling the screen . the edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles . transitions are filled with color , and celtic knots . from the trees to the floors , many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns . clock ##ing in at 70 minutes minus credits , the secret of ke ##lls is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and si ##llin ##ess thrown in to keep people ( maybe just children ) interested . i think one has to generally be open - mined to the secret of ke ##lls as half art piece , half movie about history . despite looking like it was animated with adobe illustrator , its a very nice looking movie . but based on the 20 films submitted for oscar consideration , i don ##t think it was worth being nominated over mary and max . that ##was ##jun ##k . blogs ##pot . com
well let me go say this because i love history and i know that movie is most important piece in our history and it was beautifully executed movie and julia stil ##es became my # 1 favorite actress after seeing her in " the 60s " and i own this movie in my video box with many movies and i suggest you to look for her new movies in the future and try to enjoy history !
i saw this film back at the 2005 palm springs international festival and of the 14 films i saw there i would rank this # 4 . the 900 ##+ theater was full and at the end it received a standing o ##vation . this was classic peter fa ##lk if you are a fa ##lk fan and displayed a lot of chemistry between the peter fa ##lk and paul rei ##ser characters . the films title seemed to long and too odd sounding to me . i am surprised this didn ##t make it into general release . this was far better than the majority of junk that the major studios throw at you . maybe too adult in that it was geared to the baby boom ##er and senior audience . a lot of people could relate to situations in this movie . this will probably enjoy a revival of sorts years from now when people look back at this film and consider it a kind of a gem . i would rate this 8 . 0 to 8 . 5 on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it .
i saw the original " chorus line " on broadway god knows how many times and felt the passion , despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater . michael bennett knew he would have to re - imagine " chorus " for the screen but could never figure out how to do it . if the man who came up with the show is stump ##ed - that should answer your question . there are some shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience . however , richard at ##ten ##borough fresh of the musical work of " g ##hand ##i " and dancing with animals in " doctor doo ##lit ##tle " ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show . horrible songs were added ( surprise ! surprise ! ) , great songs were dropped or given to other characters ( which didn ##t make sense ) . michael douglas was mis - cast . people that couldn ##t dance tried to act and there was the sexy " land ##ers " woman who couldn ##t sing , act , or dance - i guess she had just finished being g ##hand ##is wife . the dances by jeffrey horn ##aday look like nothing more than sc ##hl ##ock from " flash ##dance " rejects and nothing works . i sat there stunned at how something so ri ##vet ##ing and emotional could be drained to nothing . if you truly love this show and it is coming back to broadway in 2006 - see it but don ##t think that the long running musical event that was " a chorus line " has any thing at all to do with this film .
this was a very enjoyable film . a humorous , but po ##ignant look at family , and the obligations that come with it . the story of a man who comes home from his life in the city to his fathers bath house in a small chinese village . there he learns to appreciate , even cher ##ish the very things he left home to get away from . the film is as visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful .
great fun . i went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film . we came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie . in the first part you just keep asking yourself about this mali ##nsk ##i and bell ##ini stuff ( there are many more examples of this ling ##o ) and because they keep repeating the same jokes ( with different twists ) they get fun ##nier and fun ##nier . in search for this mali ##nsk ##i all the main characters are introduced the first one even wa ##cki ##er than the next . until half of the film was over we didn ##t even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing , but we sure had a good time . the house was loaded ( app ##r . 250 people ) and i think about half of them didn ##t like it and the other half loved the film . if you like weird comical movies with great dialogue you will love it . apart from cl ##oon ##ey this movie deserves a lot better than the 5 . 6 im ##db rating it has at the time i write this , but when more pp ##l have seen it i am sure it will go up . 7 . 0 is reasonable i guess , i would give it an 8 out of 10 . ( 10 out of 10 after a few beers )
this is full of major spoil ##ers , so be ##ware . " prix de beau ##te " always suffers in comparison to the two films louise brooks made with g . w . pa ##bs ##t , " pandora ##s box " and " diary of a lost girl , " but in some ways , " prix " is the qui ##ntes ##sen ##tial brooks film . here she has a chance to be charming without the dark side of her pa ##bs ##t collaboration . what " prix " has that the pa ##bs ##t films don ##t is music . in this early french film , the whole louise brooks my ##sti ##que is flesh ##ed out powerful ##ly with a conjunction of image , song and music . the charleston is what seems most associated with brooks ( she was the first to dance it in europe ) , but the essence of the actress comes across more strongly in the tango . the tango also plays a plot point in " prix , " being the music she danced with on her short rise to star ##dom after becoming miss europe . later , when she has for ##sa ##ken her fame in favor of a mundane existence as the wife of jealous husband andre , the longing for her for ##sa ##ken fame becomes apparent when the same tango record is seen on her apartment record player . so appropriate is the tango to brooks it is used to accompany the documentary about her life , " looking for lulu , " a film narrated by shirley mac ##lain ##e . the bra ##zen and forceful quality of the tango ep ##ito ##mi ##zes louise brooks strong - headed but elegant and erotic individual ##ity . the song , " je na ##i qu ##un amour , ce ##st to ##i , " adds an immense amount of path ##os to what is not a great film ( but a very good one ) . by the way , brooks voice was not dubbed for the film by edith pia ##f as some have claimed . pia ##f was born in 1915 , and wasn ##t discovered until 1935 . the song , however , is what brooks character , lucien ##ne , sings to andre at the beginning of the film to cheer him up and express her deep affection for him . and at the climax it is the song she sings for her screen test , which she views with the producers and managers who intend to shape her career . it continues on screen after husband andre , who has followed her to the screening room , shoots and kills her . in a single shot , with luc ##inen ##nes dead body in rep ##ose at the bottom of the screen while her screen test continues above with the song she once sang to andre , the essence of what movies do that other art forms do not is perfectly characterized . as andre watches his now dead wife sing to him on screen , the murder weapon still smoking , he subtly smiles . she is now his forever , and by association , ours . coincidentally , louise brooks real life career crashed and burned after " prix de beau ##te , " so it was also the death of her final starring roll as well . this film really seals the brooks my ##sti ##que more so than the pa ##bs ##t films ( which are superior films , no doubt ) . it also points out what it is about the movies that create the whole idea of the " cult " of the movies - where people like brooks , james dean and marilyn monroe live on more intensely after their death than when they were alive .
this movie was like a bad indie with a - list talent . the plot was silly , all the way to the end . it reminded me very much of something chu ##rned out for the home video market in the 1980s . i would have given it a one , but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worth ##while . i think the worst thing was the underwater scenes held off of the dock . the underwater lighting seemed to come from no were , and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air , this air tank would kind of appear . i would avoid this , unless there is nothing else on the shelf . good day .
this is my first review on im ##db , i didn ##t really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now , i feel compelled to add my perspective . and no , im not associated to the movie makers in any way ( yeah yeah how often did you here that before ; - ) ) f ##yi im in my late 20s ##1 ##st of all i have to admit i really like animated movies , because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one . not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and im ##o fresh visual style . the characters look good but far from real and it works well for the movie , after all its a fairy ##tale - like world . but the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with awesome visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this . the blue , bunny - like mini - dragon steel ##s the show and has easily some of the fun ##nies ##t moments of the movie , he is already an instant classic , much as sc ##rat from ice age . the story is not too surprising ( a bunch of anti - heroes have to go out and sl ##ay the biggest dragon you can imagine ) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds that good ; - ) 1 thing i have to point out , im ##o the movie is not suited for very young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6 - 8 i would say , these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning im ##o . anyway i had a great time watching this and can ##t wait for it to hit the stores in high def to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it . 8 , 5 for me
im a fan of art ##y movies , but regret ##fully i have to report this movie to be pre ##ten ##tious drive ##l . ago ##nis ##ingly slow to develop a non - existent plot based on a promising premise , the experience is , shall we say , trying . even after bad movies i feel that i learn something , or enjoyed some aspect , but there there was nothing to appreciate . the premise was not un ##int ##eres ##ting , but the movie starts and ends there . the acting was ok , though the characters were utterly boring . for the protagonist to aim at such an au ##da ##cious goal , she is might ##ily empty . pity . i usually enjoy movies that are un ##form ##ula ##ic , but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content .
if you are a crisp ##in glover fan , you must see this . if you are a sean penn fan , you must see this . if you are a movie fan in general , you must see this . if you have no idea who crisp ##in glover is and you have no idea who sean penn is , this film will probably still have a lot of value , but the more work you ##ve previously seen by crisp ##in or sean , the better . this movie is so funny , but it is also pure genius . there is nothing that i know of that resembles this film . it is its own genre . i doubt that anything like it will ever be made again . i cannot say anything more about exactly why without partially spoil ##ing it , and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that . in response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review , i ask that you view the film again . in reality , there is no point at which this film could fairly be called " boring . " this is possibly the fun ##nies ##t , most entertaining , and least boring film ever made . and it only gets better with age and repeated viewing ##s . a timeless classic that , unfortunately , very few will be able to claim to have seen . beaver trilogy is the brilliant work of director trent harris , also responsible for the amazing rubin and ed , which crisp ##in glover also stars in . unfortunately , copies of this film are rare and hard to find . i managed to find a vhs version after some dil ##igen ##t searching though , and there are a couple of ways to find it that i know of . but i really wish someone would put this onto a dvd .
cameron grant is one of the best directors doing adult films . his only rival is andrew blake . celeste is dynamite all thru the movie but the dr ##s office sequence with her & two other ladies is just incredible . nearly as good is asia carr ##eras performance with the construction worker . i highly recommend this movie & gave it a 9 . its almost as good as cameron grants elements of desire which i gave a 10 .
this one acts as a satire during the women ##s rights movement era . of course , that doesn ##t mean coach ( the movie ) is a wonderful experience to behold . it runs into the same vein as fast ##break ( which was better , but still tame ) , and is basically standard fare flu ##ff . what i mean for this movie being un ##int ##eres ##ting is simple to recognize . anybody who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of lunatic ##s earning their way to sudden victory makes waste . its the same feeling you may get after watching this . a nice attempt at casting the opposite sex for a mans duty , but i expected better things .
when thinking of the revelation that the main character in " bubble " comes to at films end , i am reminded of last years " mach ##ini ##st " with christian bal ##e . the only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters . an under ##sta ##ted , yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life . the title is cause for con ##tem ##pl ##ation . perhaps , we , the audience are the ones in the " bubble " as we are given no pay ##offs in the films slim 90 minute running time . audience reactions were often smug and judgment ##al , clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves . these characters are the ones people refer to as those that put george w . back in office for a second term . its sober ##ing to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role . this film has its merits , and is des ##erving of consideration for the things it doesn ##t say outright .
another example of the unique talents of cary grant . a performance worthy of oscar consideration , yet once again shu ##nne ##d by the academy . mr . grant runs the ga ##mut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city . the pit ##falls of building a home are well chronicle ##d and became the basis ( loosely ) for the more modern tom hank ##s vehicle , " the money pit " . if you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gr ##at ##uit ##ous sex , this movie is a must see .
gr ##ieving couple move to a cabin on a mountain after the loss of their daughter , discovering that there may be ghosts haunting the place , restless spirits of past occupants who committed suicide . julie p ##yk ##e ( cher ##i christian ) blame ##s husband allen ( greg thompson ) for the horrible death of their daughter due to leaving the door unlocked and the marriage has deteriorated because of it . julie remains in a zombie state , eli ##cit ##ing next to no emotion , remote and numb , only photograph ##ing a nearby abandoned prison , finding a startling image of a g ##ho ##ul girl clinging to the bars of a cell . though allen doesn ##t see anything out of the ordinary , julie continues to take pictures and we can recognize that something isn ##t quite right . a local handy ##man , jim payne ( scott hodges ) , a rather distant fellow who harbor ##s a secret becomes a dangerous threat when it is revealed that his dead mother might have something to do with the haunt ##s occurring to the p ##yk ##es . meanwhile the neighbors who sold the p ##yk ##es the cabin find themselves victims as well , alcoholic mr booths abuse to his wife coming back to haunt him . allen will conduct an investigation into the history of his cabin , attempting to un ##rave ##l the mystery about the place . plenty of ghosts moving about in the background in this somber supernatural tale with practically every character miserable . cher ##i christian remains so va ##cu ##ous and lost , its incredibly hard to connect with her despite the fact that you understand her plight . the acting , as is often mentioned , remains frustrating because none of the characters exactly are easy to latch on to . i guess its supposed to be this way , under their circumstances , but the trouble i had was never being able to properly embrace the p ##yk ##es due to their constant state of al ##oof ##ness . cher ##i comes off as cold and detached , as i figure a mother would tend to be when you lose a child in such a way , but the icy nature left me pleading inside to embrace her which i just never could . i think the right performers , even if the characters are going through an emotional turmoil , can grab the hearts of their viewers , if a humanity reaches out to us . in this movies case , the leads are unable to do so , for whatever reason . it could ##ve been me , i don ##t know . i wanted to care for them , but nothing in the characters tugged on my heart strings . anyway , as the film continues , allen slowly uncover ##s certain truths and must defend himself against his wife who has convinced herself that their daughter is among them and she won ##t lose her little girl again . jim , the unstable neighbor who believes that to stop the haunting ##s pl ##ag ##uing the area he must kill the p ##yk ##es , becomes a vital threat . the ghosts remain a central part of the movie , their presence , particularly jim ##s mother , established throughout , off in the distance . the finale reveals all of them as allen must find help for his wife while trying to th ##wart jim ##s mission . i had a hard time getting into this one due to my unease with the leads and their characters .
as a lifelong fan of dickens , i have invariably been disappointed by adaptations of his novels . although his works presented an extremely accurate re - telling of human life at every level in victorian britain , throughout them all was a per ##vas ##ive thread of humour that could be both playful or sarcastic as the narrative dictated . in a way , he was a literary car ##ica ##tur ##ist and cartoonist . he could be serious and hilarious in the same sentence . he prick ##ed pride , lamp ##oon ##ed arrogance , celebrated modest ##y , and em ##path ##ised with loneliness and poverty . it may be a cl ##ich [UNK] , but he was a peoples writer . and it is the comedy that is so often missing from his interpretations . at the time of writing , oliver twist is being drama ##tis ##ed in serial form on bbc television . all of the misery and cruelty is their , but non of the humour , irony , and savage lamp ##oon ##ery . the result is just a dark , di ##sma ##l experience : the story penned by a journalist rather than a novelist . its not really dickens at all . oliver ! , on the other hand , is much closer to the mark . the mock ##ery of official ##dom is perfectly interpreted , from the blu ##ster ##ing bea ##dle to the drunken magistrate . the classic stand - off between the bea ##dle and mr brown ##low , in which the law is described as a ass , a idiot couldn ##t have been better done . harry sec ##om ##be is an ideal choice . but the blinding cruelty is also there , the call ##ous indifference of the state , the cold , hunger , poverty and loneliness are all presented just as surely as the master would have wished . and then there is crime . ron moody is a treasure as the sl ##ea ##zy jewish fence , whilst oliver reid has bill sykes to perfection . perhaps not surprisingly , lionel bart - himself a jew from london ##s east - end - takes a liberty with fa ##gin by re - interpreting him as a much more benign fellow than was dickens original . in the novel , he was utterly ruthless , sending some of his own boys to the gallo ##ws in order to protect himself ( though he was also caught and hanged ) . whereas in the movie , he is presented as something of a way ##ward father - figure , a sort of charitable thief rather than a corrupt ##er of children , the latter being a long - standing anti - semitic sentiment . otherwise , very few liberties are taken with dickens ##s original . all of the most memorable elements are included . just enough menace and violence is retained to ensure narrative fidelity whilst at the same time allowing for children sen ##si ##bilities . nancy is still beaten to death , bulls ##eye narrowly escapes drowning , and bill sykes gets a faithful ##ly graphic come - up ##pan ##ce . every song is excellent , though they do incline towards sc ##hma ##lt ##z . mark lester mi ##mes his wonderful ##ly . both his and my favourite scene is the one in which the world comes alive to who will buy . its sc ##hma ##lt ##zy , but its dickens through and through . i could go on . i could com ##men ##d the wonderful set - pieces , the contrast of the rich and poor . there is top - quality acting from more british regulars than you could shake a stick at . i ought to give it 10 points , but im feeling more like sc ##ro ##oge today . so ##ak it up with your christmas dinner . no original has been better realised .
this is an interesting left turn for reel 13 indies . two harbor ##s is a b ##& ##w 75 minute film from minnesota that features non - actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life . i app ##lau ##d the bold ##ness of the reel 13 programmers of thinking out - of - the - box when selecting this film . i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with . as a matter of fact , i wonder if the choice had more to do with the unique ##ness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself ( not that two harbor ##s is completely without merit , but ill get to that a little later ) . as is common with independent films , two harbor ##s is limited in terms of location . there are only two real locations [UNK] a large junk dealers ##hip market and a very teen ##y trailer , which is the home of the middle - aged main character , vic , played by alex cole . writer / director james vc ##ule ##k uses the market setting to provide exposition about vic , who is one of the dealers there . he has various people walk up to vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information [UNK] vic sells space toys ( he prefers to call them " outer space action figures " ) and he is a ca ##ust ##ic asshole . this is emblem ##atic of one of the two key problems with two harbor ##s - all the chatting . iv ##e said it before and ill say it again [UNK] we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually . there are exceptions , of course , but generally , endless pat ##ter is not so engaging on film [UNK] particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition . pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and un ##ne ##ces ##sari ##ly verb ##ose . a notable example would be a few scenes which feature vic trying to play himself off as a boy scout leader in order to get a discount at a store . he argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes don ##t even advance the plot one io ##ta . this is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel long . the other problem with two harbor ##s is the acting . i may be a bit of a cu ##rm ##udge ##on when it comes to performance in film , but i really don ##t feel like there ##s a good excuse for not having good actors in your films . there are plenty of good actors out there , many of which willing to work on low - budget projects [UNK] even in minnesota . many filmmakers es ##che ##w the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals , but that is na [UNK] . in narrative film - making , next to the story , nothing is more important than the acting / performances . if you don ##t believe the people en ##act ##ing your story , your audience is lost . originally , i thought vc ##ule ##k was using non - actors , but as the film went on , i decided that they were probably community theater - type actors . it wasn ##t that they were uncomfortable on camera . its that they were overly theatrical ( i . e . big ) . granted , the best of the actors were the two leads [UNK] cole and catherine e . johnson as cassie , a lonely young girl that gets caught up in vic ##s extra - terrestrial hunt . they seemed to have the most training , but they were still a little rough around the edges . the eccentric ##ities they displayed seemed to be surface only - not coming from a real , organic place within . ms . johnson , in particular , is an interesting case . she definitely has a presence [UNK] a midwest ##ern charm about her , but that char ##ism ##a bel ##ies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have . she struggles to portray the id ##ios ##yn ##cr ##asi ##es that stem from a supposed life of solitude and ( slave ? ) labor , relying on stock gestures like eye rolls , lip biting and st ##am ##mering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world . i mentioned in the first paragraph that two harbor ##s is not completely without merit and here ##s what i mean . without giving too much away , there is a fade to white an hour into the film . after that , the story takes a stunning turn , which allows the last fifteen minutes to be ev ##oca ##tive and down ##right powerful [UNK] its like a sucker punch to the gut , but in a good way . its almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters . the last five minutes of the film don ##t have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film [UNK] subtle , detailed ( cole does his best work of the film ) and most importantly , cinematic . then , with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all [UNK] that its based on a true story , which got me to thinking . with all the dialogue , the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities , it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening re - write , two harbor ##s might make a really kick - ass stage play [UNK] maybe even a one - act . if there are any bold theater producers out there reading this , i definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker , reel 13 or whom ##ever . there might be something to this story after all [UNK] ( for more information on this or any other reel 13 film , check out their website at www . reel ##13 . org )
iv ##e bought , " the feast of all saints , " and its not truly a horrible movie , but a lot of things could have been better . it had a lot of historical value , played out by very talented actress / actors , and its not an everyday occurrence that actors can play out such a role and have it be somewhat bel ##ie ##vable . there were some parts that were a little med ##io ##cre and confusing , but i wouldn ##t say that the entire movie was horrible . once you think about that , capturing 1800s new orleans , and making something out of it , it pretty hard , and much harder to get actors who can strongly sign ##ify those parts . but the only big problem i had with the movie was that most of the actors who did play the free people of color , were mostly light skinned africans , not very universal in casting others who weren ##t light skinned ##; one of the old creole stereotypes that still exists . whom ##ever did the casting could have picked a wider variety when it came to hue , despite many creole ##s are color conscious . rather picking actors that looked near white in a sense , could have been more thought out . the actors did a great job , the script could have better written , and overall i found the performances were very bel ##ie ##vable .
i give this movie an a ##+ for the sheer camp of it ! as dietrich ##s daughter maria ri ##va wrote in the book on her mother , " if one sees the garden of allah in the context of high camp , it can be very amusing . " and how ! i laughed with delight at the over ##wr ##ough ##t score and the as ##tou ##nding ##ly , ridiculous ##ly , fantastic ##ally mel ##od ##rama ##tic dialogue . viewers who ##ve read the accounts of boyer ##s to ##up ##ee ( it kept coming un ##st ##uck in the heat ) will s ##nick ##er every time it makes an appearance . dietrich and boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines - instead they gaze dream ##ily off into the distance , presumably so their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantage ##ous light ( if your ##e starring in a turkey might as well look good ! ) . dietrich ##s costumes are out of this world . as ri ##va notes in her book , dietrich managed to steal paramount ##s travis ban ##ton and have him design some of the most divine gown ##s , such as the chi ##ff ##on beige dress & cape . i heart ##ily agree with the other reviewers who rave about the tech ##nic ##olo ##r . it really is hard to believe the film was done in 1936 - the color is fantastic . in short , if you watch the garden of allah with a len ##ient attitude and embrace its si ##llin ##ess , you can ##t help but enjoy it .
in reflecting on this movie i can think of two others to help put it in perspective . one relatively forget ##table but covering the same geography , is coup de torch ##on , the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the un ##for ##get ##table indo ##chin ##e . claire denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand under ##pin ##ning ##s of indo ##chin ##e , the complex and unspoken relationship between france and her colonial subjects . i was struck with the dignity of pot ##ee , with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses . i was also struck with the love / hate relationship between him and aimee . it is the latter that gives the film its driving force , it is the latter that links this movie to indo ##chin ##e . one never is sure what mo ##tiv ##ates everyone , though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonial ##ism . it is this cynical side of the story that ties it to coup de torch ##on . theirs is the more scandal ##ous story , perhaps even more interesting in a de ##pr ##ave ##d way , but denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and un ##res ##olved relationships . the american black who gives the grown up france a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the western world have when we look at africa . he says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother . he was coming home , but they just thought him to be a little da ##ft . france , the character and the girl , grew up in cameroon , but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was .
a great opportunity for and indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of star ##dom . it could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with john liv ##iens traumatic past and how it is tor ##turing his psyche . instead , it is a ridiculous attempt to identify john liv ##iens life with john lennon ##s . john liv ##iens sui ##ci ##da mothers hero was john lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as lennon himself . instead of focusing on john lennon ##s musical brilliance , and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life , it showed lennon ##s legacy to be that of a confused , drug addicted soul , who should looked upon as a god instead a man . i am a huge john lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another " crazy " person obsessed with lennon , lennon ##s killer , mark david chapman . lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with lennon . do we need to be reminded of that ? john lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and i was repulsed to see another disturbed person , as the main character in this movie obsessed by lennon , and not show his beautiful contributions to the world . yoko ono gr ##acious ##ly honored john lennon ##s memory , by making the memorial in central park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects , and remember john . instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide . i found this so disturbing and di ##sr ##es ##pe ##ct ##ful to lennon ##s memory . he was a man of peace who died a brutal sense ##less death , and to see such violence near this site felt like a rev ##isi ##ting a terrible wound for any lennon fan . it ruined the movie completely for me . it could have been a decent movie , but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth . let john lennon , and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this ir ##res ##pon ##sible movie .
the first thing i have to say is that i own jake speed . iv ##e seen it at least 10 times . this movie is one of the most fun movies ever made . the film begins with margaret ( karen ko ##pins ) trying to find her sister . her sister was kidnapped in paris and the family has heard nothing . along comes jake speed ( wayne crawford ) , telling her exactly where her sister is and making an offer to find her . jake speed is a hero . he doesn ##t work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure . his partner ( dennis christopher ) follows him around and writes their adventures into novels . this film is a great adventure . its hilarious , its action - packed , its just great . i guess its a cult film with a very small cult following . crawford is perfect as jake speed and throws out some one - liner ##s that you ##ll never forget . ko ##pins and christopher are also good as the girl and the sidekick , respectively . john hurt , the guy who ##s stomach blew up in alien , plays the devil ##ish , per ##vert ##ish vi ##lli ##an which just adds to the fun . in many ways , this film is similar to indiana jones , in some ways its similar to james bond films . maybe it should have been called indiana bond but whatever its title is , its a very enjoyable film .
what can i say ? an action and all ##egorical tale which has just about everything . basically a coming of age tale about a young boy who is thrust into a position of having to save the world . and more . he meets a dazzling array of heroes and villains , and has quite a time telling them apart . a definite must - see .
