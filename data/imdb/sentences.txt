0;0;i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid .
0;1;i cried every time i watched it .
0;2;it wasn ##t weird to me .
0;3;i totally identified with the characters .
0;4;and hope i won ##t be disappointed !
0;5;pu ##f ##nst ##uf rocks !
0;6;i was really drawn in to the fantasy world .
0;7;and to me the movie was lo ##oo ##ong .
0;8;i wonder if i ever saw the series and have confused them ?
0;9;the acting i thought was strong .
0;10;i loved jack wilde .
0;11;when i first saw the movie , not in 1970 .
0;12;i can still remember the characters vivid ##ly .
0;13;the flute was totally bel ##ie ##vable and i can still feel the evil woods .
0;14;witch ##y po ##o was scary - i wouldn ##t want to cross her path .
1;0;i have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about - this was a wonderful movie , and created a sense of the era that feels like time travel .
1;1;the characters are truly young , mary is a strong match for byron , claire is juvenile and a tad annoying , pol ##ido ##ri is a convincing beaten - down sy ##co ##pha ##nt .
1;2;all are beautiful , curious , and decade ##nt .
1;3;not the frightening wreck ##s they are in gothic .
1;4;gothic works as an independent piece of shock film , and i loved it for different reasons , but this works like a merchant and ivory film , and was from my readings the best capture of what the summer must have felt like .
1;5;romantic , yes , but completely re ##kind ##les my interest in the lives of shelley and byron every time i think about the film .
1;6;one of my all - time favorites .
2;0;this was soul - pro ##voking !
2;1;i am an iranian , and living in th 21st century , i didn ##t know that such big tribes have been living in such conditions at the time of my grandfather !
2;2;you see that today , or even in 1925 , on one side of the world a lady or a baby could have everything served for him or her clean and on - demand , but here 80 years ago , people ventured their life to go to somewhere with more grass .
2;3;its really interesting that these persians bear those difficulties to find pasture for their sheep , but they lose many the sheep on their way .
2;4;i praise the americans who accompanied this tribe , they were as tough as ba ##kh ##tia ##ri people .
3;0;this was a wonderful ##ly clever and entertaining movie that i shall never tire of watching many , many times .
3;1;the casting was magnificent in matching up the young with the older characters .
3;2;there are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format .
3;3;as for ju ##di den ##ch , she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which she stars .
3;4;i always make a point to see ju ##di den ##ch in all her performances .
3;5;she is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life .
3;6;i can only be grateful when i see such an outstanding picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters , good scripts and good acting .
3;7;the movie public needs heroes , not devi ##ant mani ##kins , who lack ing ##en ##uity and talent .
3;8;how wonderful to see old favorites like leslie car ##on , olympia du ##ka ##kis and cl ##eo lai ##ne .
3;9;i would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves .
3;10;thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment .
3;11;i cong ##rat ##ulate the writer , director , producer , and all those who did such a fine job .
4;0;a very close and sharp disc ##rip ##tion of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of special ##y one 18 ##year old guy , that makes his first experiences in his gay love to an other boy , during an vacation with a part of his family .
4;1;i liked this film because of his ex ##tre ##ml ##y clear and sur ##rogated storytelling , with all this " sound - close - ups " and quiet moments wi ##ch had been full of intensive moods .
5;0;but actually - it was good .
5;1;why ?
5;2;but because actually , despite what people say i thought the film was accurate in its depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy .
5;3;its not dawson ##s creek , they ##re not graceful , cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effort ##less knowledge .
5;4;they ##re kids and they act like kids would .
5;5;they ##re blunt , awkward and annoying ##ly confused about everything .
5;6;yes , this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but i don ##t think so .
5;7;a very bel ##ie ##vable performance and i loved him for it .
5;8;patricia ar ##quette is w ##hin ##y and annoying , but she was pregnant and a teenagers ?
5;9;the combination of the two isn ##t exactly lavender on your pillow .
5;10;the plot was very predictable and but so what ?
5;11;i believed them , his stress and inability to cope - her brave , yet slightly mis ##guide ##d attempts to bring them closer together .
5;12;i think the characters , acted by anyone else , would indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren ##t .
5;13;it reflects the surreal ##ity of the situation they ##re in , that he ##s sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby .
5;14;i felt angry at her for that , i felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her .
5;15;i felt it all .
5;16;in the end , i loved it and would recommend it .
5;17;watch out for the scene where der ##mot mu ##lr ##oney runs from the disastrous counsel ##ling session - career performance .
6;0;in the romanian society .
6;1;so .
6;2;to begin with the second aspect .
6;3;to make it short , it wasn ##t visible at all .
6;4;as for the first .
6;5;as i said , it had much more potential .
6;6;i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension .
6;7;much more tension .
6;8;and the potential tension didn ##t get through .
6;9;yeah .
6;10;i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack .
6;11;the actors .
6;12;not enough sensual ##ity in the key moments .
7;0;several young iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a world cup qualifying match between iran and bahrain .
7;1;when they ##re caught , they ##re penned in an area where the match remains within ears ##hot , but out of sight .
7;2;the prisoners plead to be let go , but rules are rules .
7;3;given the pe ##di ##gree of its director , ja ##far pan ##ah ##i , it was di ##sar ##ming to discover that offs ##ide is a comedy , and a frequently hilarious one .
7;4;in 1997 ##s the mirror , pan ##ah ##i presents two versions of iranian girl ##hood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is " real " .
7;5;their trans ##gre ##ssion ##s are different , but they all end up in the same tragic place .
7;6;however , thinking now about offs ##ide , its hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy , because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous .
7;7;as the women demand to know why they can ##t watch the soccer match and their capt ##ors struggle to answer , the only possible outcome is comedy .
7;8;what makes offs ##ide most affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system .
7;9;they are simply soccer fans and patriots , and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfair ##ly , they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nations grasp .
8;0;you know , i went to see " the hills have eyes 2 " wanting to like it .
8;1;i really enjoyed the original , and the remake was fairly entertaining .
8;2;they obviously had more money to throw around than wes craven did on special effects the second time around .
8;3;even though i still prefer the original film , the remake was done well , and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me .
8;4;bloody , intense , and great special effects .
8;5;in short , a great popcorn movie for any horror fan .
8;6;which brings us to " the hills have eyes 2 " .
8;7;man , where do i start ?
8;8;the plot , or lack of one , is paper thin .
8;9;we are not exactly breaking new ground here .
8;10;the military has decided to monitor the area , and all of these people turn up missing .
8;11;so what do we do now ?
8;12;lets send in the national guard to investigate .
8;13;in true hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumb ##est , and worst soldiers ever seen .
8;14;gee , iv ##e never seen that premise before .
8;15;to make a long story short , you have the mutants killing off the mor ##on soldiers one at a time in graphic fashion .
8;16;once again the special effects by nico ##ter ##o are great , but the kills no matter how graphic become boring , and predictable .
8;17;honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck .
8;18;it was bloody , and graphic , but i found it predictable , boring , and not scary at all .
8;19;for me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thought .
8;20;wes craven and his son shared the writing duties , and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror films , but sadly this isn ##t one of them .
9;0;i haven ##t seen this film in years so my knowledge is a little rusty .
9;1;i do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of brave ##heart .
9;2;it is simply more realistic and has more bel ##ie ##vable characters .
9;3;rid ##b roy looks like one would imagine rob roy to look like , messy hair and beard with simple clothing .
9;4;also the liam ness ##on has a celtic look about him , he looks like a sc ##ot and more importantly looks like rob roy .
9;5;its a comparison which anger ##s some people but compare him to mel gibson as william wallace .
9;6;gibson is supposedly playing a man who ##s legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while gibson is almost a foot shorter .
9;7;the story contains a little romance , conspiracy and an under ##dog story .
9;8;sound anything like brave ##heart ?
9;9;but instead of a film that cries out " freedom " , liberty and nationalism we get a film which says honour , love and justice .
9;10;this makes it a more interesting film .
9;11;much like glad ##ia ##tor .
9;12;the cast is fantastic and liam ness ##on is a very strong leader in this endeavour .
9;13;the story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity .
9;14;the scene where mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true scottish strength is followed by her washing the se ##men from her crotch in an extreme panic .
9;15;this is something a heroine in brave ##heart would never do .
9;16;overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch .
9;17;go and see it !
10;0;i knew i would be in for an " interesting " time .
10;1;watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so .
10;2;i find that the bachelor is often appealing and intriguing , though its quality and morality are often lacking .
10;3;on the wings of love " details the journey taken by jake , a 31 year old commercial pilot from dallas , texas , to find true love , as true a love as one can find in a season - long reality - drama dating show .
10;4;jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country .
10;5;how well can you get to know someone in a few 5 minute conversations ?
10;6;jake tries to make his true intentions known from the very beginning , at least to the audience .
10;7;or wife .
10;8;we can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition as well .
10;9;if that is the case , it might explain , to a degree , some of the women ##s actions .
10;10;the women are super competitive .
10;11;while they don ##t even know jake at all yet , they are still in it to win it no matter what the cost .
10;12;not only were the women competitive , but they were also confident and cat ##ty .
10;13;threats , backs ##ta ##bbing , and warnings of " watch out !
10;14;all show that these women weren ##t there for a good time either .
10;15;jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal , but looking for " a connection .
10;16;however , the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress jake with said sex appeal .
10;17;either low - cut or short .
10;18;while some girls seemed to maintain their sense of decor ##um , others missed that memo altogether .
10;19;one girl , chan ##ny , noted that jake was a " good guy " to whom she could be a " naughty girl .
10;20;she went on to say that jake could land on her " runway anytime .
10;21;she got fl ##ack from the other girls for her provocative statement which showed their take on these situations .
10;22;so , a reality dating show couldn ##t be that bad , could it ?
10;23;besides the obvious issue of sex - driven attraction , there are other issues that mar this seemingly harmless show .
10;24;v ##ying for someone ##s attention by fl ##au ##nting oneself to extreme proportions ?
10;25;pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the side .
10;26;another problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many of the girls bound themselves to jake .
10;27;a few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached .
10;28;one girl said " if i don ##t get that first impression rose it will kill me !
10;29;as mentioned before , they don ##t even know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose , not just one of the 15 roses to keep from being eliminated .
10;30;michelle , in particular , seemed to have some issues with attachment to jake .
10;31;the other girls noticed it too .
10;32;after one particular michelle outburst , vienna asserted that michelle had a " mental breakdown and we ##ve only been here an hour .
10;33;and was extremely emotional about it .
10;34;the other girls thought it was simply ridiculous .
10;35;another girl also cried , but because she was eliminated .
10;36;reality tv .
10;37;if we weren ##t watching the shows and giving them good ratings , the networks would not continue to run them .
10;38;the only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of america is hooked .
10;39;loves reality tv and its ensuing trapping ##s .
10;40;why is it that we even like reality tv ?
10;41;what is it about it that draws us to it ?
10;42;is it because we see the similarities to our own lives , or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others ?
10;43;whatever it is that draws us to it , we should be careful of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds .
10;44;however , i am saying that we need to evaluate each one .
10;45;season premier and episode 2 .
11;0;brian de palma ##s und ##enia ##ble vi ##rt ##uo ##sity can ##t really camouflage the fact that his plot here is a thin ##ly disguised " psycho " carbon copy , but he does provide a genuinely terrifying climax .
11;1;his " blow out " , made the next year , was an improvement .
12;0;being a fan of silent films , i looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time .
12;1;i was pretty disappointed .
12;2;as has been mentioned , the film seems to be one long , long , commercial for the maxwell automobile .
12;3;perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length that it is , i may have enjoyed the film more .
12;4;but it got old very fast .
12;5;and while i recognize that reality is stretched many times in films , without less ##ening a viewers enjoyment , what was with the mexican bandits ?
12;6;i mean , they are chasing a car through the mountains , a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour , yet they can ##t catch up to it ?
13;0;and in my opinion , a much more human and emotional version .
13;1;tom cruise plays david aa ##mes , a selfish ego ##mania ##c who takes other peoples emotions for granted , and thinks only of himself .
13;2;jason lee plays brian shelby , david ##s best , and in many ways , only friend .
13;3;penelope cruz plays sofia serra ##no , brian ##s girlfriend whom acc ##omp ##anies him to david ##s birthday party .
13;4;cameron diaz plays julie gia ##nni , david ##s occasional bed buddy .
13;5;kurt russell plays dr .
13;6;curtis mcc ##abe , a psychologist interviewing david .
13;7;all of their interactions , and the consequences of them , make vanilla sky one of the most emotional , and complex thriller ##s ever made .
13;8;i won ##t explain anymore of the plot , because its far more compelling , the less you know .
13;9;ignore all people that call this film too confusing to follow .
13;10;if you pay attention , you won ##t be confused .
13;11;the film is very complex , but not confusing .
13;12;and in my opinion , one of the best movies ever made .
14;0;this movie has some things that are pretty amazing .
14;1;first , it is supposed to be based on a true story .
14;2;that , in itself , is amazing that multiple tornadoes would hit the same town at night in the fall - in nebraska .
14;3;there is an ain ##sworth , nebraska , but there is also a town that starts with b ##lain ##s - something .
14;4;it does show the slow ##est moving tornadoes on record in the the seen where the boys are in the house .
14;5;on the other hand , the scene where the tv goes fuzzy is based in fact .
14;6;and tuned the brightness just right , you could tell if there was a tornado coming .
14;7;the problem was that by then you would be able to hear it .
14;8;since i know something about midwest tornadoes , it made this movie fun for me .
14;9;i enjoy it more than twist ##er .
14;10;i mean , give me a break - there is no way you could make it through and f ##5 by chain ##ing yourself to a pipe in a well house .
15;0;since my third or fourth viewing some time ago , iv ##e abs ##tained from la mama ##n et la put ##ain while i wait for the dvd .
15;1;in the meantime , iv ##e read the french screenplay as well as alain philipp ##ons monograph on jean eu ##sta ##che .
15;2;re - see .
15;3;even so , does she have an accent ?
15;4;i think i can tell she does .
15;5;what does the absence of color add , especially at the single spot the fringe of the city is glimpse ##d ?
15;6;how does this fringe differ from the sleep and journey that separates worlds of the tempest and the winters tale ?
15;7;di ##tto alpha ##ville .
15;8;we may imagine the el ##ap ##sed years since have done it , but does eu ##sta ##che deliberately ci ##rc ##ums ##cr ##ibe the films mil ##ieu ?
15;9;is this an enchanted isle ?
15;10;is alexandre ##s a fairy tale ?
15;11;alexandre ##s always cho ##re ##og ##raph ##ing himself , worrying about how or where to stand or walk , what to say when , announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does .
15;12;or is this his way of trying to cho ##re ##og ##raph others by doing it to himself ?
15;13;how different is he from vertigo ##s scott ##ie ?
15;14;i say , i think , very .
15;15;and tr ##uf ##fa ##uts , and god ##ards ?
15;16;isn ##t he still doing it , whatever it is , in recent roles , ir ##ma ve ##p , le porn ##og ##raph ##e , whatever , approaching old age ?
15;17;tr ##uf ##fa ##ut films .
15;18;hair , with a direction - seeking nose .
15;19;i have no idea whether this was conscious or unconscious mimic ##ry .
15;20;i was that age , but have no idea what i myself looked like then .
15;21;no scarf , at least .
15;22;i do have a brother , though , who seems to have learned his carriage from br ##ess ##on .
16;0;last november , i had a chance to see this film at the reno film festival .
16;1;i have to say that it was a lot of fun .
16;2;a few tech errors aside , it was a great experience .
16;3;i loved the writing and acting , especially from the guy that played the lead role .
16;4;there is a lot of heart in this movie , a lot of wit to .
16;5;i got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done , and they seemed real nice .
16;6;all in all the whole movie was just a positive experience , and one id definitely recommend .
16;7;the story was entertaining and cool , as a woman iv ##e been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy , and i could really understand his problems because of it .
16;8;the movie does a great job of giving us people we can sy ##mp ##athi ##ze with .
16;9;the friends in the movie are really well written to , they are realistic .
16;10;i know people like these , i only wish im ##y friends and i could sound as cool as these people when we talk .
16;11;the whole movie is just real cool , i wish there were more films out there like it .
17;0;this really was the worst movie i have ever seen .
17;1;michael var ##tan is hot , but who is this woman ?
17;2;and she looks absolutely awful through the whole movie , the hair is so bad !
17;3;they talk in like mono ##tone voices and there is no ##oo chemistry .
17;4;the cover of the dvd does not even remotely come close to what the movie actually is .
17;5;really , really boring .
17;6;i had to fast forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch .
17;7;i really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good ?
17;8;h ##ha ##ha they literally just like talk and say " yeah " and there is no passion whatsoever .
17;9;i could not tell at all that they were in love .
17;10;im sorry but this was the sad ##des ##t excuse for a movie i think i have ever seen .
18;0;before i explain the " alias " comment let me say that " the desert trail " is bad even by the standards of western ##s staring the three st ##oo ##ges .
18;1;in fact it features carmen la ##rou ##x as semi - bad girl juan ##ita , when you hear her mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as sen ##ori ##ta rita from the classic st ##oo ##ge short " saved by the belle " .
18;2;in " the desert trail " john wayne gets to play the moe howard character and eddy chandler gets to play curly howard .
18;3;like their st ##oo ##ge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53 - minute movie is moe hitting curly .
18;4;wayne ##s character , a skirt chasing bully , is not very end ##earing , but is supposed to be the good guy .
18;5;no explanation is given for wayne ##s ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl .
18;6;see wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager .
18;7;moe and curly get blamed .
18;8;so moe and curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to smith and jones .
18;9;ko ##rn ##man is the main reason to watch the mega - lame western and her scenes with moe and curly are much better than any others in the production , as if they used an entirely different crew to film them .
18;10;even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film - making is staggering ##ly bad .
18;11;the two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse .
18;12;both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground , but there is no horse in the frame , the film stock is completely different , and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider .
18;13;there is liberal use of stock footage in other places , none of it even remotely convincing .
18;14;from a cabin as the posse is gallo ##ping toward the cabin from the left .
18;15;the camera ##man follows the two st ##oo ##ges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse .
18;16;but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner .
18;17;they would film the two riders leaving and then rep ##osition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action .
18;18;or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the fore ##ground and the posse approaching in the background .
18;19;then again , what do i know ?
18;20;im only a child .
19;0;i am a huge woody allen fan and so when i saw that this was playing at the cinema i couldn ##t help myself .
19;1;i wanted to see how allen would follow up his magnificent film match point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in g .
19;2;b .
19;3;along with what seems to be his new muse scarlett johan ##son .
19;4;scoop is much lighter than mp and the humor is scoop ##s most enjoyable aspect .
19;5;who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave .
19;6;and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding .
19;7;oh and all of this is done with the help of a bum ##bling magician turned detective played by allen .
19;8;i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed johan ##sons performance but i am a bit bias , i could watch a three hour film with johan ##son in ever frame and remain enchanted .
19;9;she plays a di ##ts ##y , ya ##ppy , bum ##bling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of allen ##s stereo ##typical ne ##uro ##sis stricken character .
19;10;she adds appropriate body language for comic effect .
19;11;needles ##s to say almost anyone who sees this will find johan ##sons character sick ##ening ##ly cute and that is a plus .
19;12;allen is allen .
19;13;he is still playing the same character much like chaplin and his little tram ##p character .
19;14;something that occur in this film makes me wonder if i will see the ne ##uro ##tic little h ##yp ##och ##ond ##ria ##c again however .
19;15;he is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late .
19;16;jack ##man is also enjoyable as the su ##ave , millionaire murder suspect .
19;17;i cannot say that jack ##man does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less .
19;18;in terms of the plot i cannot help but feel that this is fresh .
19;19;in fact it stink ##s of curse of the jade scorpion .
19;20;johan ##son and allen are more detective - like than anything .
19;21;however i must app ##lau ##d allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical uno ##uts ##tan ##ding hollywood version of this film .
19;22;instead of everything being black and white , things are painted in shades of gray .
19;23;being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does une ##qui ##vo ##cal guilt .
19;24;though the plot seemed old woody still has a kn ##ack for one liner ##s .
19;25;i did find his all ##usions to his last film interesting .
19;26;come for the humor , laugh and be merry .
19;27;needles ##s to say if you enjoy allen ##s work watch it .
19;28;if not watch something else .
20;0;oh yeah !
20;1;jenna jameson did it again !
20;2;yeah baby !
20;3;this movie rocks .
20;4;it was one of the 1st movies i saw of her .
20;5;and i have to say i feel in love with her , she was great in this move .
20;6;her performance was outstanding and what i liked the most was the scenery and the wardrobe it was amazing you can tell that they put a lot into the movie the girls cloth were amazing .
20;7;i hope this comment helps and u can buy the movie , the storyline is awesome is very unique and im sure u are going to like it .
20;8;jenna amazed us once more and no wonder the movie won so many awards .
20;9;her make - up and wardrobe is very very sexy and the girls on girls scene is amazing .
20;10;specially the one where she looks like an angel .
21;0;since the advent of literature , people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love .
21;1;even more fascinating have always been the tales of impossible love , love that cannot be .
21;2;bubble " is about that .
21;3;and then it is also not .
21;4;that is tel - aviv set against the background of the political realities of israel .
21;5;the country ##s cosmopolitan and unofficial capital city doesn ##t have much in common with na ##bl ##us , a city in the palestinian west bank which also features in the film .
21;6;it doesn ##t have much in common with the tense and hate ##ful atmosphere at the palestinian checkpoint ##s .
21;7;actually , it doesn ##t seem to have much in common with anything surrounding it .
21;8;of tel - aviv allows people to have a lifestyle which isn ##t much different from what you may expect in any western city .
21;9;teenage girls looking for britney spears records , a lifestyle magazine editor looking for a sexy cover for his next issue , trend ##y people sitting in trend ##y cafes discussing trend ##y things over cups of cap ##pu ##cci ##no and other similarly trend ##y drinks , while those at home are watching the local edition of pop idol .
21;10;that also has the potential to lu ##ll ones mind into a false sense of reality .
21;11;the film evolve ##s around the lives of three young israelis who share a flat and , for the most part , try to stay out of politics .
21;12;that surrounds them " .
21;13;no ##am , a soft and easy ##going employee of a slightly avant ##guard record store , seems to be equally unwilling to engage in long political discussions and con ##tem ##pl ##ations .
21;14;against the occupation " .
21;15;yell ##i and no ##am naturally don ##t object to participating in these .
21;16;lulu and her political friends make t - shirts with the rave ##s logo , put up posters and hand out booklet ##s advertising it in the neighbourhood .
21;17;their main concern seems to be that there are never any actual palestinians participating and that the police might come and spoil all the fun for them again .
21;18;the closest they come to an actual confrontation is when they get into a sc ##uf ##fle with some not so palestinian - friendly locals who try to prevent them from handing out the leaflets .
21;19;the opening scenes of the film take us to a checkpoint on a road to na ##bl ##us where we also find no ##am doing his reserve duty .
21;20;a group of palestinians is being thoroughly checked before entering israel , among them a pregnant woman who suddenly goes into labour and gives birth to a still ##born child despite the best efforts from no ##am and the doctor who eventually arrives in an ambulance .
21;21;the woman is comfort ##ed by a young man who later turns up on no ##ams doorstep in tel - aviv with his id which the latter obviously dropped during the ordeal on the border .
21;22;his name is ash ##raf , he ##s palestinian and he ##s gay .
21;23;and he hasn ##t just come to hand back the id , he has come to see no ##am .
21;24;without a permit to live in israel and despite the initial hesitation from no ##ams flat ##mates he stays .
21;25;he soon gets a jewish name and a job at yell ##is cafe .
21;26;having grown up in jerusalem with hebrew , he doesn ##t have an arabic accent which makes it possible for him and his newly found friends to conceal his identity .
21;27;the sky is light blue and the air is sweet .
21;28;but it cannot last .
21;29;for he has become part of an equation which was never meant to be .
21;30;at one point , no ##am and ash ##raf watch a play called bent about two prisoners in a nazi concentration camp who have a love relationship which can never become physical or visible to the surrounding guards .
21;31;they find a way of being together on another level , a metaphysical one , a level where no one else has access .
21;32;this is also where our couple arrives in the end .
21;33;and it couldn ##t have been much different for them , not in today ##s israel .
21;34;bubble " is a political statement about the bubble that bursts when confronted with the political realities of today ##s israel set against the background of a beautiful and awkward love story involving an israeli and a palestinian , the impossible love story in a divided world where no such things as compromise or other colours than black and white exist .
21;35;bubble " is also a beautiful film about people , gay and straight , inhabit ##ing that strange city , tel - aviv , shown through the eyes of people who really care about them .
21;36;the films premise may have its flaws and the fatal chain of events may seem somewhat con ##st ##rued , but its strong message and emotional impact will not leave you untouched .
22;0;and you have doctor hack ##enstein .
22;1;certainly , this was obviously inspired by aforementioned films but it never material ##izes as anything special on its own .
22;2;a scientist accidentally kills his wife , so the whole movie takes place over the course of one night as he attempts to revive his wife .
22;3;to revive his wife , he decides to chop off body parts from some women that have become stranded and , coincidentally , decide to stay the night at his place .
22;4;i can ##t really say the acting is bad , nor is the directing .
22;5;everything here is just way too standard .
22;6;but that ##s hardly enough to recommend this film .
22;7;the music is decent , what blood that ##s there is decent , and the cast looks quite good .
22;8;and for half of the time , i was even entertained by this film .
22;9;but i never felt like this was anything more than a time waste ##r .
22;10;avoid ##able .
22;11;try frank ##en ##ho ##oke ##r instead .
23;0;i began riding horses fairly recently , and , as anyone who has ever ridden should know , i fell in love with horses and their world .
23;1;i rented spirit on a w ##him , just trying to pack my life full of as much horse related material as i could , and i was surprised by the results .
23;2;what i expected was a feel - good disney ##es ##que movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes .
23;3;what i got was an amazing film , filled with beautiful scenery and animation , and an amazing storyline that has the great potential to warm ones heart .
23;4;spirit is a wild mustang in the old west , whose entire world is brought crumbling down around him when he discovers the humans slowly taking over his homeland .
23;5;the story un ##fold ##s with a wide array of characters , some human , some animals , all are well written and most are pleasant to watch on screen .
23;6;i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story , and who has an appreciation for history and animals .
23;7;one thing i forgot to mention , but that i feel is important , is that the animals in this film do not talk .
23;8;this was a really nice vacation from the lady and the tram ##p animated movies that everyone today is used to .
24;0;was this i just watched ?
24;1;steven stop !
24;2;please !
24;3;this movie is ins ##ati ##ably bad and silly .
24;4;in a bizarre departure from action and adventure , mr .
24;5;wish - they - were - vampire like creatures with super human strength .
24;6;ok ?
24;7;oh , and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way ?
24;8;wow !
24;9;ego , he is somehow stronger than they are .
24;10;however all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him .
24;11;come on , i can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer , but these are super human strength people .
24;12;oh and get this , sea ##gal goes through a brief sting of identity issues , because apparently he and his co ##hort ##s in the film think he is wolverine !
24;13;oh my go .
24;14;and worst than all of that !
24;15;yes , there is a worse than that .
24;16;he has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face .
24;17;they obviously sound nothing like him and i believe it may be one of the other actors in the film .
24;18;it was pure madness .
24;19;although i wanted to turn it off i always watch a movie to he end .
24;20;this is an all time low even for your direct to video movies steven .
24;21;awful !
24;22;awful !
24;23;awful !
24;24;two thumbs down !
24;25;red ##eme ##ption qualities ?
24;26;well i guess so , i will be fair in that aspect .
24;27;at least some of the special effects were ok , and i like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses .
24;28;the women all were quite attractive im ##o .
24;29;rip off !
24;30;exile from the movie business .
24;31;about this film .
24;32;on this film .
24;33;view if you dare .
25;0;ku ##re ##ish ##i hasn ##t exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing .
25;1;recent adapted tr ##aves ##ty ##s like intimacy have ruined great writing .
25;2;but the mother sur ##pass ##es all his previous incarnation ##s , ec ##lip ##sing even my beautiful lau ##nd ##ret ##te .
25;3;a middle - aged woman overcome ##s widow - hood by having a very car ##nal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally - weak daughter .
25;4;the fact that you believe all this is credit to the quality of the acting as it is to the finite gift of the writing .
25;5;and in daniel craig we have a st ##rut ##ting , bra ##sh , gruff anti - hero who denies the audience to ever question why a young stud would con ##tem ##plate bed ##ding a sa ##gging grandmother .
25;6;beautifully shot , the film fails only in the weak depiction of the peripheral characters , but as a study of inc ##on ##ce ##iva ##ble lust , its a winner .
26;0;while watching this movie i was frustrated and distracted and by the end , i wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5 .
26;1;i thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on .
26;2;even my a .
26;3;d .
26;4;d couldn ##t keep up .
26;5;it felt like a slight acid trip .
26;6;everything looked flat , there was no dimension to anything .
26;7;there were so many shapes , lines and patterns .
26;8;i really wanted to stop the movie mid - way and smash my burned copy of this movie .
26;9;but after i finish watching it , i went online to read up on the movie and i should have done a little research into this movie before watching .
26;10;the secret of ke ##lls is loosely based on the true story about the original book of ke ##lls .
26;11;a small boy , brendan , is given the task of penn ##ing new pages in what is set to be the greatest book ever written .
26;12;this book will contain information that will help " change darkness into light .
26;13;brendan lives in the village of ke ##lls behind huge stone walls .
26;14;taking place in the 8th century , brendan ##s uncle , the abbot of ke ##lls , is trying to build the wall to keep the vikings out .
26;15;brendan ##s uncle insist he help complete the wall , but a traveler and keeper of " the book " secretly trains brendan to hon ##e in on his illustration skills , and convinces him to complete " the book " and carry out its word .
26;16;the entire time i watched the movie i thought i was missing something because i didn ##t really understand what was going on .
26;17;i figured i was just missing a piece of irish history .
26;18;a simple google search taught me all i needed to know about the original book of ke ##lls .
26;19;after reading many articles , my opinion of the movie greatly changed .
26;20;the book of ke ##lls is a copied version of the first few books of the new testament transcribed into latin by gaelic monks in ireland in the 8th century .
26;21;along with its pale ##ographic and ins ##ular script , the book is also beautifully illustrated in ins ##ular art , a type of early art form know for its int ##rica ##cy , complexity , and miniature illustrations .
26;22;much of the art in the book of ke ##lls is depicted as lots of art was at the time , flat and dimensional ##ity challenged with no perspective .
26;23;but what makes the book of ke ##lls stand out from other early pieces of art is its use of many colors .
26;24;the secret of ke ##lls is very colorful .
26;25;i originally thought the animation was flat and boring .
26;26;it reminded me a lot of the cartoon samurai jack which also had a flat and " amin ##e " look to it .
26;27;once i learned about the art styles of the book of ke ##lls , its obvious that many of the styles from the book are mimic ##ked in the movie .
26;28;there are lines and swirl ##s and various shapes that inhabit brendan ##s mind .
26;29;whenever he goes into his imagination , circular shapes resembling the sun , co ##gs , clocks and wheels begin filling the screen .
26;30;the edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles .
26;31;transitions are filled with color , and celtic knots .
26;32;from the trees to the floors , many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns .
26;33;interested .
26;34;i think one has to generally be open - mined to the secret of ke ##lls as half art piece , half movie about history .
26;35;despite looking like it was animated with adobe illustrator , its a very nice looking movie .
26;36;but based on the 20 films submitted for oscar consideration , i don ##t think it was worth being nominated over mary and max .
26;37;that ##was ##jun ##k .
26;38;blogs ##pot .
27;0;well let me go say this because i love history and i know that movie is most important piece in our history and it was beautifully executed movie and julia stil ##es became my # 1 favorite actress after seeing her in " the 60s " and i own this movie in my video box with many movies and i suggest you to look for her new movies in the future and try to enjoy history !
28;0;i saw this film back at the 2005 palm springs international festival and of the 14 films i saw there i would rank this # 4 .
28;1;theater was full and at the end it received a standing o ##vation .
28;2;this was classic peter fa ##lk if you are a fa ##lk fan and displayed a lot of chemistry between the peter fa ##lk and paul rei ##ser characters .
28;3;the films title seemed to long and too odd sounding to me .
28;4;i am surprised this didn ##t make it into general release .
28;5;this was far better than the majority of junk that the major studios throw at you .
28;6;maybe too adult in that it was geared to the baby boom ##er and senior audience .
28;7;a lot of people could relate to situations in this movie .
28;8;this will probably enjoy a revival of sorts years from now when people look back at this film and consider it a kind of a gem .
28;9;i would rate this 8 .
28;10;to 8 .
28;11;on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it .
29;0;i saw the original " chorus line " on broadway god knows how many times and felt the passion , despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater .
29;1;michael bennett knew he would have to re - imagine " chorus " for the screen but could never figure out how to do it .
29;2;if the man who came up with the show is stump ##ed - that should answer your question .
29;3;there are some shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience .
29;4;however , richard at ##ten ##borough fresh of the musical work of " g ##hand ##i " and dancing with animals in " doctor doo ##lit ##tle " ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show .
29;5;surprise !
29;6;surprise !
29;7;michael douglas was mis - cast .
29;8;people that couldn ##t dance tried to act and there was the sexy " land ##ers " woman who couldn ##t sing , act , or dance - i guess she had just finished being g ##hand ##is wife .
29;9;the dances by jeffrey horn ##aday look like nothing more than sc ##hl ##ock from " flash ##dance " rejects and nothing works .
29;10;i sat there stunned at how something so ri ##vet ##ing and emotional could be drained to nothing .
29;11;if you truly love this show and it is coming back to broadway in 2006 - see it but don ##t think that the long running musical event that was " a chorus line " has any thing at all to do with this film .
30;0;this was a very enjoyable film .
30;1;a humorous , but po ##ignant look at family , and the obligations that come with it .
30;2;the story of a man who comes home from his life in the city to his fathers bath house in a small chinese village .
30;3;there he learns to appreciate , even cher ##ish the very things he left home to get away from .
30;4;the film is as visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful .
31;0;great fun .
31;1;i went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film .
31;2;we came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie .
31;3;they get fun ##nier and fun ##nier .
31;4;in search for this mali ##nsk ##i all the main characters are introduced the first one even wa ##cki ##er than the next .
31;5;until half of the film was over we didn ##t even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing , but we sure had a good time .
31;6;app ##r .
31;7;and i think about half of them didn ##t like it and the other half loved the film .
31;8;if you like weird comical movies with great dialogue you will love it .
31;9;apart from cl ##oon ##ey this movie deserves a lot better than the 5 .
31;10;im ##db rating it has at the time i write this , but when more pp ##l have seen it i am sure it will go up .
31;11;is reasonable i guess , i would give it an 8 out of 10 .
32;0;this is full of major spoil ##ers , so be ##ware .
32;1;prix de beau ##te " always suffers in comparison to the two films louise brooks made with g .
32;2;w .
32;3;pa ##bs ##t , " pandora ##s box " and " diary of a lost girl , " but in some ways , " prix " is the qui ##ntes ##sen ##tial brooks film .
32;4;here she has a chance to be charming without the dark side of her pa ##bs ##t collaboration .
32;5;what " prix " has that the pa ##bs ##t films don ##t is music .
32;6;in this early french film , the whole louise brooks my ##sti ##que is flesh ##ed out powerful ##ly with a conjunction of image , song and music .
32;7;but the essence of the actress comes across more strongly in the tango .
32;8;the tango also plays a plot point in " prix , " being the music she danced with on her short rise to star ##dom after becoming miss europe .
32;9;later , when she has for ##sa ##ken her fame in favor of a mundane existence as the wife of jealous husband andre , the longing for her for ##sa ##ken fame becomes apparent when the same tango record is seen on her apartment record player .
32;10;so appropriate is the tango to brooks it is used to accompany the documentary about her life , " looking for lulu , " a film narrated by shirley mac ##lain ##e .
32;11;the bra ##zen and forceful quality of the tango ep ##ito ##mi ##zes louise brooks strong - headed but elegant and erotic individual ##ity .
32;12;by the way , brooks voice was not dubbed for the film by edith pia ##f as some have claimed .
32;13;pia ##f was born in 1915 , and wasn ##t discovered until 1935 .
32;14;the song , however , is what brooks character , lucien ##ne , sings to andre at the beginning of the film to cheer him up and express her deep affection for him .
32;15;and at the climax it is the song she sings for her screen test , which she views with the producers and managers who intend to shape her career .
32;16;it continues on screen after husband andre , who has followed her to the screening room , shoots and kills her .
32;17;in a single shot , with luc ##inen ##nes dead body in rep ##ose at the bottom of the screen while her screen test continues above with the song she once sang to andre , the essence of what movies do that other art forms do not is perfectly characterized .
32;18;as andre watches his now dead wife sing to him on screen , the murder weapon still smoking , he subtly smiles .
32;19;she is now his forever , and by association , ours .
32;20;coincidentally , louise brooks real life career crashed and burned after " prix de beau ##te , " so it was also the death of her final starring roll as well .
32;21;it also points out what it is about the movies that create the whole idea of the " cult " of the movies - where people like brooks , james dean and marilyn monroe live on more intensely after their death than when they were alive .
33;0;this movie was like a bad indie with a - list talent .
33;1;the plot was silly , all the way to the end .
33;2;it reminded me very much of something chu ##rned out for the home video market in the 1980s .
33;3;i would have given it a one , but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worth ##while .
33;4;i think the worst thing was the underwater scenes held off of the dock .
33;5;the underwater lighting seemed to come from no were , and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air , this air tank would kind of appear .
33;6;i would avoid this , unless there is nothing else on the shelf .
33;7;good day .
34;0;this is my first review on im ##db , i didn ##t really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now , i feel compelled to add my perspective .
34;1;f ##yi im in my late 20s ##1 ##st of all i have to admit i really like animated movies , because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one .
34;2;not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and im ##o fresh visual style .
34;3;the characters look good but far from real and it works well for the movie , after all its a fairy ##tale - like world .
34;4;but the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with awesome visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this .
34;5;the blue , bunny - like mini - dragon steel ##s the show and has easily some of the fun ##nies ##t moments of the movie , he is already an instant classic , much as sc ##rat from ice age .
34;6;thing i have to point out , im ##o the movie is not suited for very young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6 - 8 i would say , these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning im ##o .
34;7;anyway i had a great time watching this and can ##t wait for it to hit the stores in high def to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it .
35;0;im a fan of art ##y movies , but regret ##fully i have to report this movie to be pre ##ten ##tious drive ##l .
35;1;ago ##nis ##ingly slow to develop a non - existent plot based on a promising premise , the experience is , shall we say , trying .
35;2;even after bad movies i feel that i learn something , or enjoyed some aspect , but there there was nothing to appreciate .
35;3;the premise was not un ##int ##eres ##ting , but the movie starts and ends there .
35;4;the acting was ok , though the characters were utterly boring .
35;5;for the protagonist to aim at such an au ##da ##cious goal , she is might ##ily empty .
35;6;pity .
35;7;i usually enjoy movies that are un ##form ##ula ##ic , but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content .
36;0;if you are a crisp ##in glover fan , you must see this .
36;1;if you are a sean penn fan , you must see this .
36;2;if you are a movie fan in general , you must see this .
36;3;if you have no idea who crisp ##in glover is and you have no idea who sean penn is , this film will probably still have a lot of value , but the more work you ##ve previously seen by crisp ##in or sean , the better .
36;4;this movie is so funny , but it is also pure genius .
36;5;there is nothing that i know of that resembles this film .
36;6;it is its own genre .
36;7;i doubt that anything like it will ever be made again .
36;8;i cannot say anything more about exactly why without partially spoil ##ing it , and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that .
36;9;in response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review , i ask that you view the film again .
36;10;in reality , there is no point at which this film could fairly be called " boring .
36;11;this is possibly the fun ##nies ##t , most entertaining , and least boring film ever made .
36;12;and it only gets better with age and repeated viewing ##s .
36;13;a timeless classic that , unfortunately , very few will be able to claim to have seen .
36;14;beaver trilogy is the brilliant work of director trent harris , also responsible for the amazing rubin and ed , which crisp ##in glover also stars in .
36;15;unfortunately , copies of this film are rare and hard to find .
36;16;i managed to find a vhs version after some dil ##igen ##t searching though , and there are a couple of ways to find it that i know of .
36;17;but i really wish someone would put this onto a dvd .
37;0;cameron grant is one of the best directors doing adult films .
37;1;his only rival is andrew blake .
37;2;two other ladies is just incredible .
37;3;nearly as good is asia carr ##eras performance with the construction worker .
37;4;gave it a 9 .
37;5;its almost as good as cameron grants elements of desire which i gave a 10 .
38;0;this one acts as a satire during the women ##s rights movement era .
38;1;is a wonderful experience to behold .
38;2;and is basically standard fare flu ##ff .
38;3;what i mean for this movie being un ##int ##eres ##ting is simple to recognize .
38;4;anybody who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of lunatic ##s earning their way to sudden victory makes waste .
38;5;its the same feeling you may get after watching this .
38;6;a nice attempt at casting the opposite sex for a mans duty , but i expected better things .
39;0;when thinking of the revelation that the main character in " bubble " comes to at films end , i am reminded of last years " mach ##ini ##st " with christian bal ##e .
39;1;the only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters .
39;2;an under ##sta ##ted , yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life .
39;3;the title is cause for con ##tem ##pl ##ation .
39;4;perhaps , we , the audience are the ones in the " bubble " as we are given no pay ##offs in the films slim 90 minute running time .
39;5;audience reactions were often smug and judgment ##al , clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves .
39;6;these characters are the ones people refer to as those that put george w .
39;7;back in office for a second term .
39;8;its sober ##ing to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role .
39;9;this film has its merits , and is des ##erving of consideration for the things it doesn ##t say outright .
40;0;another example of the unique talents of cary grant .
40;1;a performance worthy of oscar consideration , yet once again shu ##nne ##d by the academy .
40;2;mr .
40;3;grant runs the ga ##mut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city .
40;4;for the more modern tom hank ##s vehicle , " the money pit " .
40;5;if you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gr ##at ##uit ##ous sex , this movie is a must see .
41;0;gr ##ieving couple move to a cabin on a mountain after the loss of their daughter , discovering that there may be ghosts haunting the place , restless spirits of past occupants who committed suicide .
41;1;for the horrible death of their daughter due to leaving the door unlocked and the marriage has deteriorated because of it .
41;2;julie remains in a zombie state , eli ##cit ##ing next to no emotion , remote and numb , only photograph ##ing a nearby abandoned prison , finding a startling image of a g ##ho ##ul girl clinging to the bars of a cell .
41;3;though allen doesn ##t see anything out of the ordinary , julie continues to take pictures and we can recognize that something isn ##t quite right .
41;4;a rather distant fellow who harbor ##s a secret becomes a dangerous threat when it is revealed that his dead mother might have something to do with the haunt ##s occurring to the p ##yk ##es .
41;5;meanwhile the neighbors who sold the p ##yk ##es the cabin find themselves victims as well , alcoholic mr booths abuse to his wife coming back to haunt him .
41;6;allen will conduct an investigation into the history of his cabin , attempting to un ##rave ##l the mystery about the place .
41;7;plenty of ghosts moving about in the background in this somber supernatural tale with practically every character miserable .
41;8;cher ##i christian remains so va ##cu ##ous and lost , its incredibly hard to connect with her despite the fact that you understand her plight .
41;9;the acting , as is often mentioned , remains frustrating because none of the characters exactly are easy to latch on to .
41;10;i guess its supposed to be this way , under their circumstances , but the trouble i had was never being able to properly embrace the p ##yk ##es due to their constant state of al ##oof ##ness .
41;11;cher ##i comes off as cold and detached , as i figure a mother would tend to be when you lose a child in such a way , but the icy nature left me pleading inside to embrace her which i just never could .
41;12;i think the right performers , even if the characters are going through an emotional turmoil , can grab the hearts of their viewers , if a humanity reaches out to us .
41;13;in this movies case , the leads are unable to do so , for whatever reason .
41;14;it could ##ve been me , i don ##t know .
41;15;i wanted to care for them , but nothing in the characters tugged on my heart strings .
41;16;anyway , as the film continues , allen slowly uncover ##s certain truths and must defend himself against his wife who has convinced herself that their daughter is among them and she won ##t lose her little girl again .
41;17;jim , the unstable neighbor who believes that to stop the haunting ##s pl ##ag ##uing the area he must kill the p ##yk ##es , becomes a vital threat .
41;18;the ghosts remain a central part of the movie , their presence , particularly jim ##s mother , established throughout , off in the distance .
41;19;the finale reveals all of them as allen must find help for his wife while trying to th ##wart jim ##s mission .
41;20;i had a hard time getting into this one due to my unease with the leads and their characters .
42;0;as a lifelong fan of dickens , i have invariably been disappointed by adaptations of his novels .
42;1;although his works presented an extremely accurate re - telling of human life at every level in victorian britain , throughout them all was a per ##vas ##ive thread of humour that could be both playful or sarcastic as the narrative dictated .
42;2;in a way , he was a literary car ##ica ##tur ##ist and cartoonist .
42;3;he could be serious and hilarious in the same sentence .
42;4;he prick ##ed pride , lamp ##oon ##ed arrogance , celebrated modest ##y , and em ##path ##ised with loneliness and poverty .
42;5;but he was a peoples writer .
42;6;and it is the comedy that is so often missing from his interpretations .
42;7;at the time of writing , oliver twist is being drama ##tis ##ed in serial form on bbc television .
42;8;all of the misery and cruelty is their , but non of the humour , irony , and savage lamp ##oon ##ery .
42;9;the story penned by a journalist rather than a novelist .
42;10;its not really dickens at all .
42;11;oliver !
42;12;on the other hand , is much closer to the mark .
42;13;the mock ##ery of official ##dom is perfectly interpreted , from the blu ##ster ##ing bea ##dle to the drunken magistrate .
42;14;the classic stand - off between the bea ##dle and mr brown ##low , in which the law is described as a ass , a idiot couldn ##t have been better done .
42;15;harry sec ##om ##be is an ideal choice .
42;16;but the blinding cruelty is also there , the call ##ous indifference of the state , the cold , hunger , poverty and loneliness are all presented just as surely as the master would have wished .
42;17;and then there is crime .
42;18;ron moody is a treasure as the sl ##ea ##zy jewish fence , whilst oliver reid has bill sykes to perfection .
42;19;perhaps not surprisingly , lionel bart - himself a jew from london ##s east - end - takes a liberty with fa ##gin by re - interpreting him as a much more benign fellow than was dickens original .
42;20;whereas in the movie , he is presented as something of a way ##ward father - figure , a sort of charitable thief rather than a corrupt ##er of children , the latter being a long - standing anti - semitic sentiment .
42;21;otherwise , very few liberties are taken with dickens ##s original .
42;22;all of the most memorable elements are included .
42;23;just enough menace and violence is retained to ensure narrative fidelity whilst at the same time allowing for children sen ##si ##bilities .
42;24;nancy is still beaten to death , bulls ##eye narrowly escapes drowning , and bill sykes gets a faithful ##ly graphic come - up ##pan ##ce .
42;25;every song is excellent , though they do incline towards sc ##hma ##lt ##z .
42;26;mark lester mi ##mes his wonderful ##ly .
42;27;both his and my favourite scene is the one in which the world comes alive to who will buy .
42;28;its sc ##hma ##lt ##zy , but its dickens through and through .
42;29;i could go on .
42;30;i could com ##men ##d the wonderful set - pieces , the contrast of the rich and poor .
42;31;there is top - quality acting from more british regulars than you could shake a stick at .
42;32;i ought to give it 10 points , but im feeling more like sc ##ro ##oge today .
42;33;so ##ak it up with your christmas dinner .
42;34;no original has been better realised .
43;0;this is an interesting left turn for reel 13 indies .
43;1;w 75 minute film from minnesota that features non - actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life .
43;2;i app ##lau ##d the bold ##ness of the reel 13 programmers of thinking out - of - the - box when selecting this film .
43;3;i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with .
43;4;as is common with independent films , two harbor ##s is limited in terms of location .
43;5;a large junk dealers ##hip market and a very teen ##y trailer , which is the home of the middle - aged main character , vic , played by alex cole .
43;6;director james vc ##ule ##k uses the market setting to provide exposition about vic , who is one of the dealers there .
43;7;and he is a ca ##ust ##ic asshole .
43;8;this is emblem ##atic of one of the two key problems with two harbor ##s - all the chatting .
43;9;we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually .
43;10;particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition .
43;11;pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and un ##ne ##ces ##sari ##ly verb ##ose .
43;12;a notable example would be a few scenes which feature vic trying to play himself off as a boy scout leader in order to get a discount at a store .
43;13;he argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes don ##t even advance the plot one io ##ta .
43;14;this is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel long .
43;15;the other problem with two harbor ##s is the acting .
43;16;i may be a bit of a cu ##rm ##udge ##on when it comes to performance in film , but i really don ##t feel like there ##s a good excuse for not having good actors in your films .
43;17;even in minnesota .
43;18;performances .
43;19;if you don ##t believe the people en ##act ##ing your story , your audience is lost .
43;20;originally , i thought vc ##ule ##k was using non - actors , but as the film went on , i decided that they were probably community theater - type actors .
43;21;it wasn ##t that they were uncomfortable on camera .
43;22;i .
43;23;e .
43;24;cole and catherine e .
43;25;johnson as cassie , a lonely young girl that gets caught up in vic ##s extra - terrestrial hunt .
43;26;they seemed to have the most training , but they were still a little rough around the edges .
43;27;the eccentric ##ities they displayed seemed to be surface only - not coming from a real , organic place within .
43;28;ms .
43;29;johnson , in particular , is an interesting case .
43;30;a midwest ##ern charm about her , but that char ##ism ##a bel ##ies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have .
43;31;slave ?
43;32;labor , relying on stock gestures like eye rolls , lip biting and st ##am ##mering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world .
43;33;i mentioned in the first paragraph that two harbor ##s is not completely without merit and here ##s what i mean .
43;34;without giving too much away , there is a fade to white an hour into the film .
43;35;its like a sucker punch to the gut , but in a good way .
43;36;its almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters .
43;37;and most importantly , cinematic .
43;38;that its based on a true story , which got me to thinking .
43;39;maybe even a one - act .
43;40;if there are any bold theater producers out there reading this , i definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker , reel 13 or whom ##ever .
43;41;for more information on this or any other reel 13 film , check out their website at www .
43;42;reel ##13 .
44;0;iv ##e bought , " the feast of all saints , " and its not truly a horrible movie , but a lot of things could have been better .
44;1;actors , and its not an everyday occurrence that actors can play out such a role and have it be somewhat bel ##ie ##vable .
44;2;there were some parts that were a little med ##io ##cre and confusing , but i wouldn ##t say that the entire movie was horrible .
44;3;once you think about that , capturing 1800s new orleans , and making something out of it , it pretty hard , and much harder to get actors who can strongly sign ##ify those parts .
44;4;one of the old creole stereotypes that still exists .
44;5;whom ##ever did the casting could have picked a wider variety when it came to hue , despite many creole ##s are color conscious .
44;6;rather picking actors that looked near white in a sense , could have been more thought out .
44;7;the actors did a great job , the script could have better written , and overall i found the performances were very bel ##ie ##vable .
45;0;for the sheer camp of it !
45;1;as dietrich ##s daughter maria ri ##va wrote in the book on her mother , " if one sees the garden of allah in the context of high camp , it can be very amusing .
45;2;and how !
45;3;i laughed with delight at the over ##wr ##ough ##t score and the as ##tou ##nding ##ly , ridiculous ##ly , fantastic ##ally mel ##od ##rama ##tic dialogue .
45;4;will s ##nick ##er every time it makes an appearance .
45;5;if your ##e starring in a turkey might as well look good !
45;6;dietrich ##s costumes are out of this world .
45;7;cape .
45;8;i heart ##ily agree with the other reviewers who rave about the tech ##nic ##olo ##r .
45;9;it really is hard to believe the film was done in 1936 - the color is fantastic .
45;10;in short , if you watch the garden of allah with a len ##ient attitude and embrace its si ##llin ##ess , you can ##t help but enjoy it .
46;0;in reflecting on this movie i can think of two others to help put it in perspective .
46;1;one relatively forget ##table but covering the same geography , is coup de torch ##on , the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the un ##for ##get ##table indo ##chin ##e .
46;2;claire denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand under ##pin ##ning ##s of indo ##chin ##e , the complex and unspoken relationship between france and her colonial subjects .
46;3;i was struck with the dignity of pot ##ee , with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses .
46;4;hate relationship between him and aimee .
46;5;it is the latter that gives the film its driving force , it is the latter that links this movie to indo ##chin ##e .
46;6;one never is sure what mo ##tiv ##ates everyone , though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonial ##ism .
46;7;it is this cynical side of the story that ties it to coup de torch ##on .
46;8;theirs is the more scandal ##ous story , perhaps even more interesting in a de ##pr ##ave ##d way , but denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and un ##res ##olved relationships .
46;9;the american black who gives the grown up france a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the western world have when we look at africa .
46;10;he says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother .
46;11;he was coming home , but they just thought him to be a little da ##ft .
46;12;france , the character and the girl , grew up in cameroon , but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was .
47;0;a great opportunity for and indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of star ##dom .
47;1;it could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with john liv ##iens traumatic past and how it is tor ##turing his psyche .
47;2;instead , it is a ridiculous attempt to identify john liv ##iens life with john lennon ##s .
47;3;john liv ##iens sui ##ci ##da mothers hero was john lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as lennon himself .
47;4;instead of focusing on john lennon ##s musical brilliance , and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life , it showed lennon ##s legacy to be that of a confused , drug addicted soul , who should looked upon as a god instead a man .
47;5;i am a huge john lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another " crazy " person obsessed with lennon , lennon ##s killer , mark david chapman .
47;6;lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with lennon .
47;7;do we need to be reminded of that ?
47;8;john lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and i was repulsed to see another disturbed person , as the main character in this movie obsessed by lennon , and not show his beautiful contributions to the world .
47;9;yoko ono gr ##acious ##ly honored john lennon ##s memory , by making the memorial in central park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects , and remember john .
47;10;instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide .
47;11;i found this so disturbing and di ##sr ##es ##pe ##ct ##ful to lennon ##s memory .
47;12;he was a man of peace who died a brutal sense ##less death , and to see such violence near this site felt like a rev ##isi ##ting a terrible wound for any lennon fan .
47;13;it ruined the movie completely for me .
47;14;it could have been a decent movie , but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth .
47;15;let john lennon , and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this ir ##res ##pon ##sible movie .
48;0;the first thing i have to say is that i own jake speed .
48;1;iv ##e seen it at least 10 times .
48;2;this movie is one of the most fun movies ever made .
48;3;trying to find her sister .
48;4;her sister was kidnapped in paris and the family has heard nothing .
48;5;telling her exactly where her sister is and making an offer to find her .
48;6;jake speed is a hero .
48;7;he doesn ##t work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure .
48;8;follows him around and writes their adventures into novels .
48;9;this film is a great adventure .
48;10;its hilarious , its action - packed , its just great .
48;11;i guess its a cult film with a very small cult following .
48;12;crawford is perfect as jake speed and throws out some one - liner ##s that you ##ll never forget .
48;13;ko ##pins and christopher are also good as the girl and the sidekick , respectively .
48;14;john hurt , the guy who ##s stomach blew up in alien , plays the devil ##ish , per ##vert ##ish vi ##lli ##an which just adds to the fun .
48;15;in many ways , this film is similar to indiana jones , in some ways its similar to james bond films .
48;16;maybe it should have been called indiana bond but whatever its title is , its a very enjoyable film .
49;0;what can i say ?
49;1;an action and all ##egorical tale which has just about everything .
49;2;basically a coming of age tale about a young boy who is thrust into a position of having to save the world .
49;3;and more .
49;4;he meets a dazzling array of heroes and villains , and has quite a time telling them apart .
49;5;a definite must - see .
